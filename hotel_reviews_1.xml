		<Negative_Review> I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location the room was a little bigger for the usual London hotel room The staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel They provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic I enjoyed my stay overall</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Very definitely the breakfast Fruit selection limited Very little input from staff Many 4 star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table The fried eggs were dry and inedible They clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished The outlook on to the garden was lovely </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> When staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the Club Lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade I thought this was a bit mean spirited Also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room chocolates in the room and a free drink at the bar Lovely welcome touch The location is superb</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We couldn t check in with two attempts even at 2 45pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone 9pm Although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Our room was lovely and the staff were attentive welcoming and very helpful </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Went for a club room Badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it Good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful The room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms I have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space I found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay At checkout time the staff were politely informed that I could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst I went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from London which was most appreciated Overall I had an enjoyable stay at the Grand Royale London Park Hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to London </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The checking in and checking out processes are very slow with staff not taking any notice of people arriving Serving people in the wrong order is just annoying first come first served should be respected Not enough of a problem to be negative but be prepared to be assertive </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Good location for Hyde Park Queensway tube station is just around the corner Pleasant and traditional hotel with wooden panelled reception and large lounge yet modern rooms and good facilities for a one night stay </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Most people traveling on business travel really early to make 8am meetings London being a metropolitan you d think people could book in at 9am at least luckily for me I could freshen up and get to court by 9am your staff from reception to pool breakfast and room service were all friendly and professional Honestly was a pleasure being in the Hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> This hotel markets itself as a 4 star and charges four star prices I suspect the French don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star There was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for 5 minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that I was male he proceeded to imply that I was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way This attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that Novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors To make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room Authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore I m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately Although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint The contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms The bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small The water ran hot and cold intermittently For some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa The aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Reception area restaurant and bar very contemporary the wifi was very good as was the breakfast The staff in the bar area were excellent especially the mixologist and waiter who were very friendly helpful and informative </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It was advertised as having a covered walkway directly into the 02 arena Unfortunately on arrival I discovered it was still under construction This was the main reason I chose this hotel as a solo traveller There was a good selection of coffee but no ordinary breakfast tea Only green tea fruit tea I like a good ordinary cuppa Had to buy teabags at local tesco Having said all this I cannot fault the hotel it was excellent Good location very clean I think the covered walkway will be an added bonus when completed I will definitely stay here again </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Lovely new hotel very friendly welcome Cleanliness was superb Bed was so comfortable with very high quality bed linen Had a wonderful sleep Close to 02 underground station </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The breakfast dishes are not well prepared and takes ages for example the porridge was very wattery and had no taste not the first time it happens We were waiting for more than 20 mins to get two coffees and two porridges If you are not on vacations this is unacceptable I do not know what all these staff people are doing running through the breakfast room with stressed faces A capuccino costs extra for a more than 20 GBP breakfast I would expect any breakfast typical drink like coffee to be included This time I hade a room where the wi fi signal was so poor that I could only get wi fi in the bathroom Cell connection was also not possible not even voice Some rooms are not well maintained I had one were the shower would not work </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The staff are fairly up themselves I didn t feel particularly welcome My room was substandard Yes it looks very trendy and I can t fault that you do get an iron decent hair dryer iPhone dock as standard However The sink in the middle of the room is a novelty to be cool but is fairly annoying and inconvenient The showerhead sprayed in all directions clearly needing a decent de scaling The automatic light also didn t go out in the shower room neither did the fan It wasn t the best night sleep I ve had in a hotel The location is noisy Particularly on a Saturday night You are right next to china town and Leicester Square Expect lots of noise from outside Unfortunately it extends inside too as the bar is popular with the early 20 s crowd dressed up to the hills all thinking they are being exclusive and classy by paying over the odds for cocktails so it s busy and noisy in the communal areas Be warned if you want a late drink at the hotel bar you will be battling with the public to get served and the bar staff are quite slow Being all male behind the bar on the night I was there meant all the pretty young girls were getting served first and i stood there growing ever more annoyed at being ignored I did asked to switch rooms for my second night which was met with a look of inconvenience Almost as though they hadn t ever been asked this before They didn t particularly apologise for the genuine problems with my room It was a Sunday night and I know they had lots of empty rooms It was hardly a big request Any tourists staying here please take note NOT to use their car service It is outrageous what they charge I did a 7 min journey due to bad weather and was charged 18 Being from south London I know that should have cost around 5 8 max You will be much better off walking 30 secs to the main road and getting a black cab or downloading uber Don t let them rip you off </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location It s very modern and looks good You can easily get anywhere from this location The rooms are smart and overall it does feel impressive but beauty is only skin deep </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The breakfast was chaotic Very busy fine but the actual buffet area was very small and badly organised For example the plates for a cooked breakfast were on the other side away from the serving area so people were milling about to try to get what they needed I had stayed in the Doubletree Hilton in Glasgow the weekend before and the breakfast and hotel overall was much better </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Perfect location We were going to a concert at the Albert Hall and it is comfortable walking distance Mind you that is why I chose this hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Our air conditioner was broken and the room was very hot The staff seemed somewhat indifferent They did offer a fan and suggested we open the window Sadly the street noise was unbearable so we closed the window and sweated it out for two nights as the hotel was booked full The third night they did move us to a cooled room which was wonderful We were grateful for that In the second room everything was clean and well kept All the glassware in the first room had obviously been used By prior guests as there were lip marks and fingers prints on them We had expected the second night we would have received clean glasses but we got the same ones over again For a hotel which could be top notch with such little effort this was disappointing I wish I could give top marks and really want to say I loved this place but it fell short They are so close to having a really great hotel so I hope they will address some of these issues </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The beds were comfy and the public areas were all very nice The breakfast and the dining room staff were wonderful The location could not have been better just blocks from South Kensington tube and Kensington palace Museums very close walking distance We enjoyed the neighborhood very much </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Deluxe room did not meet the pictures and therefore expectations of the room big differences in quality and size we were extremely disappointed Room was on the side of the street which is extremely loud during nights on the weekend as the hotel also kind of functions as a bar club Bathroom was not perfectly clean when we arrived Service was not good e g had to ask multiple times until we received a second test size sachet of body lotion you could expect two people to get two portions of body lotion though </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The property was in the ideal area for our short break We were booked on a day trip with Belmond and an exit at the Hotel leads straight on to Victoria Station from where the Belmond train departed </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> A far way out of the city good links to train and metro but you need public transport to go anywhere </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location to two metro stops on line 13 ideal for travel into major spots Staff lovely bakery right on the corner really nice Value for money good if you book ahead on booking com Not quite 4 if you are being picky but some nice touches like free tea and pastry down stairs in the afternoon We loved it be careful of down town Moulin Rouge can get a bit seedy</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Some staff were rather stiff and unsmiling although others especially Joe were very friendly and helpful Not particularly cheap even by central London standards given that breakfast was not included </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location very handy for transport Although our first room was quite noisy there is a fire station and an ambulance depot very close by so lots of sirens and a bit of general traffic noise and the double glazing didn t seem all that effective we were moved to a quieter room when we requested it after the first night </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Fire alarm broke out at 3 am no staff were present to help with evacuation guests especially with young children were left with no help or directions No explanation was given on reason for setting off the alarm Hotel management needs to comprehensively review its fire directions and operative measures Hotel needs to modernize its facilities especially its safety and security measures Hotel management expressed apologies but didn t offer any compensatory gestures for guests even symbolic Overall the stay in the hotel was ok but did not rise up to the expected standards of a Marriott </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Staff is badly organized Value for money is poor a design hotel with cheap furniture night side table wheel broke of lighting concept is inadequate only one lift worked during our stay we were on the 5th floor The Halloween party in the lobby was a disaster we waited to order a drink for halve an hour since it took the bar tender about 30 minutes for two drinks he was also all alone to serve the entire bar When we finally could order they didn t have mint to make Mochitos we pointed out to them that there was mint but then they didn t have knives to cut the limes so again we waited for 15 minutes In between a waitress took an order for a Cuba Libre but it never was served The bar was messy and the staff clearly totally overburdened This hotel is way too expensive for what they have to offer </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room we booked was too old and too small and we upgraded to another renovated one and ended up paying fashion week fair an extra 100euro per night The room was not clean although we informed the receptionist on our way out but when we came back it wasn t cleaned either On our last 2 days our used cups of tea were still on the table and there was no water refill in the mini bar the sink still had our toothpaste traces we called housekeeping and they assured us they will clean up once we leave for dinner and when we came back the room was still the same The beds are not very comfy and they have a heating chauffage in the bathroom that is burning hot and so wronly placed that we both burned our hands and arms The breakfast is very poor in variety and presentation although the breakfast staff were very friendly Apon checking out we told the receptionist about the lack of cleanliness there was no apology he only said he will inform them </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> They announce free WiFi But it is very very poor You must reconnect with your credentials every other moment and it is really slow When I commented the issue they replied that unfortunately several clients where connecting at the same time And what did they expect </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> As hotels go in Paris this one is correct comfortable clean and well located near Bastille and Le Marais Rooms are OK no complaint but I don t see exactly the point of calling this a 4 boutique hotel beyond the fact that uit has a nicely decorated lobby</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Due to my unexpected sickness I needed to shorten my UK trip When I checked in I asked the night shift female receptionist if there would be any flexibility and possibility to cancel or refund partial hotel booking fee Of course I fully understood of the terms and conditions Regrettably she rejected immediately and spoke to me loudly at the lobby that you don t need to speak to me so rude but I didn t and I recommend you to claim the insurance instead of asking the hotel for assistance just a request I was completely and totally shocked by her unhelpful manner Next day morning the hotel manager has provided assistance after she understood the situation </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The bar restaurant in the hotel was very nice The main elevator was being refurbished so we received a complimentary drink on the house </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The staff was very courteous and helpful Bed and pillows were very comfortable Location was ideal very close to all the major sights and to the underground There were also plenty of places for a quick lunch or food to go It also helped that there was a Tesco Express 2 doors away and a Sainsbury s across the street I would definitely stay at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Grafton again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The staff new little about the area on arrival and made little effort to find out If you go to this hotel make sure they do not put you in a room next to the main road it s next to a hospital and I was kept awake by ambulances all night The room was mediocre and in my opinion not at all worth the money paid I m aware that this is London and you pay for the location but for a radisson I m very disappointed </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Their service is pretty terrible We initially got a room where the air conditioning and some lights weren t working so we were moved to another room however we were later told that the following day we need to move again to another room because someone else had already booked this room I looked at 4 different rooms and none of them were up to mark basic things like light and air conditioning not working and the manager basically said too bad you have to pick one we have nothing else I would understand if I was being unnecessarily fussy but I would expect working lights the rooms are already quite dark and basic air conditioning </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Very ugly building from the 1960 70s probably the ugliest in the whole area I am pretty sure that many parts of the building haven t been renovated since The hotel needs massive modernisation refurbishing The 15th floor restaurant was so sad I left it immediately Beautiful views at least It took literally 15 minutes for the water to get warm in the shower what a waste of water resources Taking a quick shower is not possible at this hotel Where does the hot water come from The middle of the earth Even then the temperature was not constant I was given a first room with very poor wifi reception I got moved to a second room which was next door to a lift shaft and it was pretty noisy London is expensive for hotels But honestly who gives stars to hotels in UK 4 stars for this place Cmon</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Smell of wc everywhere poor and very old rooms beds windows cabinets No repairs like 30 years or more Smell is so strong that you can not breath Price was like for 5 star hotels I know london is a place for tourists and idiots you can not expect good food or good hotel But if you pay 200 pounds for a night And you booked hotel 1 5 month before Will never stay there again I was surprised of rates for this hotel My rate is 3 points and of course 2 star hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> If I would say one negative it would be that the rooms downstairs do hear a fair amount of noise through the ceiling when guests come through the front door It is not all the time and not enough to warrant a room change but it is a shame it is so well sound proofed from wall to wall but there is that slight noise there HONESTLY THOUGH this is finding a minor fault and not something that would put me off staying </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I have returned to the Park Grand Lancaster gate around 4 or 5 times now I believe it will always be my number 1 choice in London now The staff are great Really helpful They are accommodating to your needs from the moment you arrive until you leave It is just a very tightly run ship that prides itself on customer satisfaction Location is fantastic I love that part of London shops restaurants transport and easily in town in a few moments The rooms are great Elemis toiletries are a lovely touch My Club Twin is such a good size I honestly would find it hard to pin point a negative Great stay Cannot wait to stay again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Difficult to get a seat when you feel like going down for some coffee Too many walk ins hotel guests have to wait for walk ins from outside to leave before they get a seat Only when the staff at the restaurant overheard me one night saying to my wife that I don t want to sit in the corridor again did they realise we are hotel guests and made space for us Most peculiar </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The WiFi was awful We needed to do some work while on holiday and using the WiFi was imposible Had to resort to tether through my phone at roaming charges Not happy I was on floor 3 Could only use Wifi just about very slow from the ground floor </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The Hotel location is excellent There is even a little bakery next door where you can have nice crepes Bed was hard so great for my liking but the pillows too cushiony lumpy so my head was too bent Resorted to sleep with no pillow Have to say the cleaning was fantastic I felt I was in a new room every time I came to my room Reception was always very helpful Breakfast was nice </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> London hotels are pricey in general and this was no exception Disliked that only breakfast option was huge buffet priced at more than 25 Local direct dialed calls are supposed to be free but I was charged until I protested Bathtub drain was totally clogged and not fixed when I reported it although apology received at checkout Liked it enough to consider staying again</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Newly refurbished attractive liked the location directly across from Kensington Gardens and near Notting Hill short ride via subway into center of town Staff very helpful Super clean </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We booked a King size room bed but stil both the room and the bed were quite small The bathroom was absolutely tiny You could just about get in the door and close it behind you and had to squeeze past the small sink in the corner and carefully try to manouver 180 degrees to sit down on the toilet which was wedged behind the shower cubicle I am average size but a bigger person would never have been able to use this bathroom or shower Also the doors to the rooms are very poorly insulated you could hear everything outside as if the door was open including a lengthy and loud conversation between cleaning staff very early in the morning </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very friendly staff lovely location across the road from Kensington Gardens </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Overpriced and overrated with laughable priced drinks Bathroom needed updating grouting shabby stain around base of toilet bowl This hotel lives on it s tradition reputation and it s name I think it could do with stepping up the mark in terms of refreshing each room s d cor Overall it was OK but there are other 5 hotels with better facilities and more realistic prices It s a shame as was expecting so much more It was a nice experience though </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> really comfy bed Fantastic bar area with really great atmosphere Be warned you need to book a table in the bar even if you are a guest Professional and courteous manager who responded well to our comments and sorted things out rapidly and with respect </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Comfortable hotel with good spa facilities You get given a mobile that has free calls and mobile Internet which would be great for international Travellers The spa is free and has a great swimming pool sauna and steam room </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Small rooms even by London standards although they are beautifully decorated The Superior one we had this time did actually allow two of us to move about at one time so marginally better than the standard room we had on our previous visit </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location decor and comfort are all very good This is undoubtedly a pleasant hotel in a beautiful building and the location in Great Russell Street makes it convenient for a number of activities Walkable to theatres museums and tourist sights and near several bus routes </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I had a single room and it was REALLY small especially the bathroom Later in the trip I stayed at a different hotel a little further out of the city in Kingston and got a double room easily twice as big for half the money and just as nice It s a little more complex to get into city from Kingston but I ll take that effort to save 150 a night So to me the value for money wasn t great In fairness the common areas were very nice so the best strategy is to use them until it s time to go to sleep </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> A really nice boutique hotel with ultra attentive staff and a lot of character and style A block to South Kensington tube station which gives quick access to Heathrow and to all of central London Also easy walk to Victoria and Albert Museum if you are doing any touristing </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The booking was made by myself for my son The response of the staff and inflexibility in their manner was extremely disappointing They were not prepared to accept a cash payment for the booking and were prepared to turn my son away even though the room had been secured with a debit card They would not accept payment by phone with the debit card details and were very rigid in their approach I would not ever recommend Britannia Hotels to anyone</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The location is a short journey away from the main attractions however the tube station is about 300m away and it s only a 5 15min journey costing 1 80 each to anywhere in Paria so I wouldn t say it s a negative For our budget this was perfect and I d stay again The tube is so reliable </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel was so nice to come back to after a busy day of exploring Paris I liked how close it was to the tube station Porte De Champerret I think that s spelt correctly would have been useful to know beforehand which stop it was Comfy bed nice clean bathroom with complimentary shampoo soap etc A very chic boutique it feels very Parisian and the staff were very helpful </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Building work in progress so awakened by scaffolding falling at 8am on a Sunday morning Probably not the hotel s fault however as they tried their best to minimise the inconvenience </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Good service in the breakfast room Very good service by the desk manager who arranged for a change of room when my wife hurt herself on the bathroom door jamb Also made sure we got a taxi for our return journey</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had a good view of the street from the first room but had to shift up another room as I requested for twin beds The view in the second room was blah much to the disappointment of my niece There was a power trip on the floor we were on the last night Restored only in the morning But didn t affect us much as i opened the window for cool air </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Bed was most comfy Have stayed in many hotels including the big brands no bed in these hotels was as comfy as this one Room had excellent soundproof windows Boutique artistic feel Extremely central location the Lourve is your neighbor Probably one of the loveliest boutique hotels I ve stayed in </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Payment terms I booked for my boss and had requested to process all payments by visa details that I had provided during the booking process in the meantime hotel contacted me to fill out form for Visa approval I do understand their point as I did not send the form as requested and they were not going to allow Mr Andres in the room whilst he arrived in the middle of the night and staff gave him a really hard time to this and in fact we will not consider using this hotel again would have expected a better service since he had already made use of this hotel previously so I thought this issue could have waited till the next morning where I could send the form filled in or else even drop me an email to remind me to fill it out so definitely service is not good at all </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was a small issue with Concierge bringing our luggage up to the room as reception had forgotten to notify them but the professionalism of the staff when I phoned them from the room was superb it really was no hassle at all to us and only a VERY light complaint well not really a complaint we all make mistakes Concierge phoned us then the Manager phoned us shortly after to see if we were happy which we were as they treated us well</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Amazing view from our River facing Room Excellent service Friendly staff Good value for the scenery and facilities on offer Great food to room service at 12 30am Well stocked mini bar</Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> I stayed in the executive suite and the view was breath taking Staff was so friendly and helpful Facilities were great ice bucket and glasses with mini bar a little space to put your personal items in ice machine on same floor as the room I found the bar and restaurant on the expensive side and decided not to eat there but had a drink Again the staff were lovely Very clean and modern bar If I visit London again I will look to stay in this hotel again as the location was fantastic </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Room smelled bad as did a lot of the hotel common areas The room was really small and in the basement which I apparently couldn t move My kids felt it was sort of creepy Tiny bathroom and the bathroom door closet door and edge of bed are will with about 10 inches of each other Must plan ahead when maneuvering around with multiple kids in the room too I mainly stayed there because I needed to stay in that specific area I will look for a different hotel next time </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> This friendly hotel was located in a convenient location Close to Latin Quarter Metro and buses Classic room was small but comfortable The hotel provided afternoon tea in the foyer which was a bonus and filtered water was available The staff offered helpful advice and useful suggestions Nothing seemed too much trouble This was my second visit </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The size of the room If you have a suitcase each there is no room to lay them down to get into them however when we were moved to the suite on the 5th floor there was plenty of room and made the rest of our stay very comfortable </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel was extremely clean and well presented the staff were excellent my only dissapontment was the size of the room from the pictures on the web they look a lot roomier however after 3 days we were able to be moved to a lovely suite on the 5th floor which was perfect we had a lovely view of the Louvre and the church next door which was excellent This suite also had a coffee machine A very big thank you to all the staff </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Me and my friend stayed in the economic double bedroom The room size is ok Did wish it could be a bit bigger as there s hardly space to sit on except for the bed We also find it s a bit difficult to find a big enough space to open a slightly bigger suitcase 29 inch without blocking the bathroom door </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Nice stylish hotel Location is great the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the tube station and 10 minutes walk from the British Museum and the west end A very handy small fridge in the room with free water and milk provided The hotel also provide free pack of light breakfast for each guest </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We sent a email regarding our room to be in a quiet location in the hotel away from lifts ect before we arrived as we had to travel from abroad When we got to our room it was opposite the lift We paid for a upgrade on our room and the extras were not in our room when we arrived Also there must have been a school party at the hotel And they were on our floor and in the next room to us So they were very loud banging on doors screaming shouting ect So we complained and was able to move eventually to a different part of the hotel and we got the extras that we paid for in our room Plus the manager gave us a bowl of fruit two little bottles of wine and chocolate Also we had a bit of a refund as we were staying three nights Plus the pictures on the Internet look lovely of the hotel but a bit deceiving As the rooms and hotel are a lot smaller than what they look on the Internet </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There were two problems during my stay 1 I paid for breakfast on Saturday Sunday and Monday morning but was told after I had my breakfast on the table that I was not entitled to breakfast on Monday morning as I had not paid and that if I wanted it it would cost 50 50 Saturday and Sunday mornings were fine I was then asked to leave without eating anything This was so embarrassing After collecting my things and checking out I mentioned it to the staff on the front desk who told me I had paid for breakfast on Monday morning and that I should have had it At this point it was too late And I left the Doubletree with a really bad feeling and hungry as I had paid for something I was denied I probably wouldn t go back as a result despite its safe and clean rooms 2 I was on the 5th floor and it was really noisy From 3am the noise started people banging doors and chatting in the corridor Not good for jet lag or a good night s sleep </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I thought the hotel was clean safe and easily accessible by public transport </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Rooms were small but I think that s a common theme in London</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very clean and the staff were very helpful Despite being a good distance from the downtown core it was very easy to get in and out of the city Right along the Piccadilly line so it was very convenient Restaurants groceries pharmacy etc all close by Great alternative to staying in the city core which would be much more expensive Great experience Would go back </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Just a couple of things that would have given top ratings all round a bath robe Sky tv 10 Manchester street hotel provide these the other hotel I often stay at nearby Most importantly having doors that are well fitted so don t let the bright light from the landing shine in all night long Such a shame when they ve gone to the effort of fitting superb blackout curtains Also the mirror in the rooms is at a poor height for doing hair and make up Too high if seated and too low if standing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Love the room I stay regularly and they always give me my same favourite room The staff are exceptional too </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The breakfast was nice but not nearly worth 18 euro It was nice but better to have half that price Also should have had coffee tea and kettle in the room Finally we were in room 55 and the water pipes woke me early each day made the hangovers harder to overcome when I woke at 7am each day </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were amazing Without a doubt they were the friendliest happiest and most helpful in any hotel They were fun and funny too Not stiff and formal but relaxed and seemed to really think about what we might need Offered a bottle of water to take out with us on a hot day is a great touch </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Check in desk a bit informal You feel like you are entering a restaurant not a hotel When I checked in it was more expensive than I d booked Not told that they take a deposit Went for breakfast was told it wasn t included I knew that was one reason I had booked the hotel as it included breakfast When I queried it I had to show my email from booking com to prove it assured I d be refunded Find it funny I didn t get a receipt Hotel said that s normal </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very helpful as we arrived early to see if we could leave our bags as was off to the theatre check in was in middle of the show They let us check in early as they had a room available Convenient location nice setting</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We booked this hotel for the rooftop bar expecting a nice chilled drink looking over the Square We went up before going to bed only to be met with a private party in section of roof with a view then were sat in middle of roof with no view at all Drinks also seemed overly expensive which i wouldn t have minded had we had a decent view It all seemed very pretentious and not what we expected at all </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It s just a bit 3 4 mins walk to the main road like it is kind of the beginning of the oxford street so you have to walk 10 mins to get to the middle but i dont really mind actually because trading off with hotel facilities and service i would rather choose to stay here rather than smaller room in the middle of oxford street at the same price </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location of course Hermes toiletries so fab Staff super professoional 5 star service Last time I used to stay at Radissom blu berkshire a bit further in the middle of oxford street but staff is not well trained and room is quite small</Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The breakfast room was great with a beautiful glass canopy offering a view of the sky The staff was kind and attentive The underground is just across the road so it is very convenient and the hotel is just one stop away from places to eat Situated in a nice neighbourhood </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was not four star I can forgive the tired furnishings but the bed which folded up into the wall was very uncomfortable We felt that the low price meant we had been given a sub standard room </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location was quiet yet handy for the tube and walking access to the areas we needed to visit </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> A couple of members of staff were a bit too groovy which translated as rude but only a couple Bed was fabulously comfy but the room very small which I know is all part of the ethos and is why there is such a wonderful space downstairs </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I know hotel breakfasts are never cheap so I shouldn t complain but with everything else about this hotel being so great I d have loved to have had breakfast there too only I couldn t justify spending 28 a day for the two of us </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Hotel staff are usually nice but usually because they have to be CitizenM s staff though are the absolute nicest most welcoming staff I ve ever known It also has the only hotel lobby bar that I ve ever actually wanted to spend time in Oh yeah and the room itself was great too as is the location I ve travelled all over the world and this is honestly my new favourite hotel anywhere </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The TV did not work Had to request an engineer but due to this being late in the day we were not able to enjoy this whilst we were getting ready to go out Also I wasted time trying to work out why it wasn t working etc which wasn t easy as it was pinned to the wall The duty manager working that day 26 03 16 appeared to be sympathetic but was not prepared to offer us any kind of incentive to come back to the hotel so I am sorry to say this will be the first and last time we will book the radisson anywhere </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only minus was the area surrounding the bathroom basin as it was tiny and no room to put anything </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Friendly reception staff and very attractive hotel from the outside and in Spotlessly clean everywhere Our room No 14 had a big carved bed and the sheets were crisp and the towels white and fluffy The room was very comfortable I misheard breakfast timings and arrived a little late however the lady in charge let us have breakfast and couldn t have been more pleasant or accommodating </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We only stayed for one night however we had a member of staff walk into our room at 8 am I am assuming this was housekeeping however since we were checking out in three hours we saw this as pointless and quite rude There wasn t a knock or announcement the staff member just walked in </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is perfect The Eiffel Tower was a 2 minute walk away which meant we could sneak out before the crowds and catch the sunrise over the Eiffel Tower then go back for breakfast The staff at check in check out were fast and efficient A large selection of food available for breakfast Go down early as it got really busy from 9 am onwards The price was a little steep however in comparison to other properties available it was worth the money </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The fact that the bar and meal tabs had an auto service charge of 12 5 applied to them plus space for adding an extra gratuity creates an opportunity for inadvertently over tipping </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The perfect location for exploring and enjoying all that London s Southbank area has to offer The friendliness and professionalism of all the staff was evident throughout from those on reception to the bar restaurant staff and the ladies who serviced our room </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only problem if it could be called a problem was that the music in the lifts was rather loud and did not seem to fit with the otherwise quiet ambience of the hotel s reception and room areas </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The room was very spacious and bed comfortable The room which had originally been booked had a bathtub shower and I had some difficulty in getting in and out Therefore I made a request to reception for a room with walk in shower and this was provided quickly and efficiently with help being given in moving our luggage to the other allocated room </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> tv remote stopped working Once we called for help this issue was solved very quickly and with minimum fuss </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We knew we were in for a good experience as we walked into the modern hotel reception Greeted by friendly staff who soon had us settled in our room and were quick to help with any requests we had throughout our stay Simple but stylish modern room was well recieved by my other half comfortable easy chairs bed etc we ate at the OXO tower which is a two minute if that walk so made for very relaxing night Nice chilled atmosphere during the evening and cool surroundings in downstairs bar breakout area Sitting watching people strolling along southbank late in the evening was nice touch All topped with fantastic central location for our Christmas break Will be staying again I hope </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Due to business reasons I informed the hotel that I was about to check out around 2 or 3pm and they said only able to check out at 2pm However due to traffic in London I rushed to the hotel at 2 45pm to check out the staff at the reception and the cleaning staff gave me a very nasty look and implied I came too late to check out which was very unpleasant I understood the late June was a busy period for the hotel because I travelled a lot and stayed many times in the hotel and staff have always been very friendly and accommodating but the experience I had this time was not good </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I felt the decor of the rooms were a little outdated in comparison to the communal areas of the hotel The mustardy yellowy tones of the rooms felt a little old fashioned </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We held our mums 60th birthday here in the mezzanine of the Manhatten Bar Grill The staff that served us that evening were absolutely fabulous Robert Klopper and Rob The shower was lovely which is unusual in big hotels like that in my experience The food for our dinner was absolutely gorgeous and all compliments to the chef The bar area was lovely too Also wonderful views of the river from my room </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Had to wait for ages to get into the parking garage and wasn t told before booking that it was 25 a night Also I think it s disgusting in this day and age that hotels charge for wifi It was 12 a day I would expect the Hilton of all hotels to provide this free of charge I ended up hotspotting my friend the whole trip so he didn t have to pay The room was quite old with a very old mouldy smell in the bathroom and as for the view well we were probably given the worst room in the whole hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was a little too small inadequate space for 2 pieces of luggage so we had to manage the space constraint by maneuvering around Good for a short 1 2 days stay but might be challenging for 2 people over a long stay But the bed was comfortable and room was quiet the windows were adequately sound proofed My daughter and I had a good night s sleep Have booked to return for another two nights soon </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The complimentary wifi simple but adequate breakfast convenient location near the tube station and shopping along Kensington High Street and most importantly the efficient and accomodating service of the Manager and staff at the Seraphine </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The air conditioning was broke and didn t fall under the responsibility of the staff so they simply switched on the overhead fan The beds were on wheels so every time I moved during the night my bed skid across the wood flooring The location is a bit of a step outside the centre but there are good links to all public transport also </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The breakfast buffet was exceptional The staff seemed nice and helpful also Good room facilities with iron and ironing board included </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Hopefully you are not planning on using the tv for entertainment my iPad mini could win a competition for size The room is old fashioned and out dated matching the kettle from the 90 s The walls are paper thin and we could hear the conversations being held in the room beside us and the people walking in the room above This is not great when it happens until past 3am The breakfast was average not worth the amount they ask for </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Don t take room 500 trains right under the hotel and finish passing at midnight and starts in the morning Cracked window Water in shower without pression Reception told me u had an upgrade maybe because it was a triple instead of a double so there was more space but was the only room facing the underground lines on the 5th floor The house keepers should wait a minute after they knock at the door before they go in </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> We had to leave early for a train connection to France The hotel supplied us with a lovely take out breakfast I would recommend this hotel for a good quite nights sleep in London and for location to St Pancras station </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Only one tiny wee thing we moved things out of the bar fridge to make way for our own food and drinks On checkout everything in the bar fridge had been charged to our account because they have sensors in the fridge to indicate when something has been removed They accepted my explanation without hesitation but it was a little bit embarrassing all the same </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Wasn t given any information regarding meals specifically breakfast which led us to believe breakfast didn t start until 9 on the Saturday so we went elsewhere Found out from another guest that breakfast is served for guests only earlier down stairs It would have been nice to know this from the start of our stay to save us finding somewhere else to eat Even an informtion poster or clearer information in the rooms would help</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The rooms and locations were excellent</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I stayed at many hotels in 2016 and I never wrote a review before But because of the appalling stay I had at this hotel I decide to rate my experience which was HORRIBLE First the room was booked for someone else whose name were on the screen but they gave it to us for some reasons we didnt get Second the room we had was freezing and we couldn t increase the temp at night The wind was below through the window like AC Never had night like this before in all hotels we stayed in And what made it worst is the staff were so rude in the next morning when we asked them if we can get one night refund because we left the hotel second day even though we paid for two night Unbelievable experience so bad </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The best small hotel in London Great location in a quiet mainly residential area of Kensington but near to a mix of bars restaurants and cafes to suit all tastes and close to 2 underground stations as well This hotel is a new concept that absolutely works primarily because the staff are excellent and totally committed to making it work The idea is that as you are in London you will get out and experience all that the capital has to offer and the staff are amazing in making this happen</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It would have been nice to have a bath and there was a faint smoky smell in the room as if someone had been smoking in there recently not something we felt that needed reporting but it was noticeable </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great location great price the staff at reception and at breakfast were very friendly they looked after our bags the day we checked out so we got an extra day in London the room size was good the bed was great the kitchen was very big there were two showers in the shower so that was good for me and my girlfriend Overall it was a great trip and great experience </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Just two small concerns the bed was quite hard I travel a lot and this wasn t a firm mattress it was hard My wife likened it to sleeping on a board Secondly bit cramped in the dining room we stayed on a weekday I can imagine at the weekend it would be even more crowded Also a cooked breakfast is available for an extra cost something we would have gone for if we were made aware of it We were halfway through our continental breakfast before we found out that this option was available</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location good for West End as Earls Court Tube Station is very close Hotel very clean staff helpful We stayed in an executive double room which was a good size with a modern bathroom Although our room was at the front road noise etc from outside the building was not too noticeable </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It is indeed convenient to Ealing but a train ride to central London It used to offer tremendous value for money now more variable as I imagine they have more demand for rooms so can charge more We had a problem with the heating in our first room but staff sorted it out the next day </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We have stayed at Xanadu three times and come back because we like the atmosphere Staff are always helpful and do their best to help out Rooms are quiet and though the hotel was full we did not hear anyone else We tried the on site restaurant also realy good We will be back </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The lamp in our room didnt work The satellite cable used to go off and the tv was displayed with no source After change of sheets on our second day we returned to tea coffee stained sheets Staff make you wait a long time even if they don t have any customers to deal with Especially the ones that help around the kitchen Found a fried egg with a hair on it right infront of the chef and she failed to detect it Completely put me off breakfast that day The underground car park seemed very risky as no sufficient lighting also had some young teens running in past midnight which concerned me and my wife For 660 3 night stay I d expect a lot more Compared to 740 i paid for flights and accommodation to Sofitel Dubai last summer this was a 1 star experience The UK needs to renovate the shoddy buildings it s a class below the rest of the world Wouldn t recommend this hotel at all Pay a bit more for something in the city Novotel etc Location is not the best it s about 15min walk from nearest underground and 3 min ferry ride and 9min walk to Canary Wharf station The area itself feels unsafe The hotel doesn t even offer water Me and my wife would take our own bottles at breakfast as the two bottles are finished by the time we get to breakfast around 9am We had a Queen guest room which we upgraded to a better view for 20per night as the others were taken Absolute extortion Room was relatively small The bathroom was a joke The tub and tiles had limescale and the sink was very low and really small Had to wash my hands at the side of the tap because I couldn t lather them directly under it If you try to wash your face water spills everywhere They have a bar across our side of the room Apparently they had a prom night for students Loud music went on past midnight which could be easily heard through the glass like I was sleeping outside Very narrow lift and corridors </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The ferry ride to Canary Wharf was complimentary for hotel guests but due to lack of other services we might as well have paid for it </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The fact my friend got charged twice When we checked in we both payed half each for the hotel so we payed the full price on the first day When we checked out we were told that my friends payment did not go through and that she needed to pay again We advised that she received a receipt confirming payment however we were still told she needed to pay the price The member of staff who checked us out was incredibly rude and very patronising It was out of order especially for a Hilton hotel My friend paid and when we left she phoned her bank who advised that she had been charged twice By this point we had left the hotel so I phoned the hotel and spoke again to the rude member of staff who was again very rude and patronising she said on the phone that the bank were lying and that only one payment had gone through and was adamant this was the case She advised that she would send an email to confirm Once we received this email it contradicted everything this staff member said and advised that it was correct my friend had been charged twice My friend had to make a formal complaint regarding this matter and it ruined my opinion and expectation of Hilton hotels </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The bed was very comfy and on the first day the receptionist we had was lovely The birthday treat was a fantastic touch </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Terrible location We specifically booked this hotel because booking com said this hotel was 0 8 miles from Tobacco docks where we were attending the BAFTA gaming awards that evening We could have stayed at any hotel but chose this one based purely on location value for money What a joke 0 8 miles should take no more than 5 minutes in a taxi And it probably was 5 minutes from our destination ACROSS THE RIVER The reality of it was a 20 minute journey via car Booking com need to make this clear on their website as we were then late We also paid extra from a room upgrade A superior Twin room Well all I can say is God knows what the standard twin room was like because there was nothing superior about the superior twin It was tiny The bathroom was so small I didn t even have room to dry myself off after the shower It reminded me of being on a boat The layout of the hotel is also horrendous Upon check in you are given an elevator number a floor number and a room number All of the elevators are located in different locations across the hotel It was like a maze We had to ask for help in the end as lift 5 was no where to be seen Eventually after walking through the main building across a bridge and around several corners we finally found it And that was just to get the lift up to our floor Oh and suprise suprise despite us having 2 suitcases 2 suit carriers and a carry on bag not one person offered to help take our stuff to the room </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Check in was ok Guests are given a hot cookie upon check in which was a nice touch Decor throughout the hotel reception is nice</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> For a hotel in this class one would have expected a mini bar or at least a fridge in the room An outside seat and table on the balcony would have been a bonus </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Fantastic riverside location with idyllic ferry service across the river Only 3 minutes from Canary Wharf Comfortable room with a view Excellent breakfast Friendly polite and efficient staff Bus service C10 right outside the door to Rotherhithe and Victoria </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Good value for money in the off season During summer the rates can be a little on the higher end as it is considered a four star hotel The staff seem to maker an effort to give customer service based on HIlton standards </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> A GREAT HOTEL MAKES FOR A GREAT START TO YOUR DAY Check in time even with 3 other people in the lobby was a painless 7 minutes carried our bags to the room called the room shortly after we arrived in case we had any questions good WiFi very few places can say that in London newly remodeled quick and HUGE elevator compared to all others in Europe immaculate bathroom Android phone so helpful used it every day comfy beds slept with the window open in April room better than expected very smart use of the space closet with shelves and hanging space free water and snacks opened the front door for us every time fresh flowers at reception 4 minute walk to Paddington Station charming neighborhood great Indian restaurant one block away easy in house breakfast held our luggage on the last day while we got in some more sightseeing and ALL the staff is genuine helpful professional and friendly It makes a difference to walk through the lobby and have everyone eager to serve you and they manage to do it without being fake or overbearing This was my second trip to London this will be where I stay next time for sure </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Room and staff quality was excellent I didn t buy a SIM card since I was only there for a day so the icing on the cake was the free phone with unlimited data and local calls that the hotel provided during the stay It helped me tremendously when I was getting around London using Google maps as needed </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> no free breakfast checking in was a hassle We needed to wait more than 2 hours before our room was ready you continually have to sign in for wifi each time you come back to the hotel not far from the hotel is a neighbourhood which does not look safe quite far from the city centre but doable the atm is not near You have to walk approximately 10 minutes to find one</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The rooms are clean and totally doable across the street are a few restaurants and also a small supermarket close to the metrostation on the 4th floor there is a place where you can iron your clothes youself wifi is good</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was tiny and there wasn t a traveler compatible outlet in the bathroom but that s my only complaint Not a deal breaker by any means </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> This was a very central location which I loved Walking distance to most everything or a two block walk to the nearest underground station The staff was very helpful and friendly I d definitely stay there again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> This booking was a complete disappointment The hotel is old and worn down with cracks in the walls and stained carpets Although I had requested a double bed I was given a room with two singles The desk clerk asserted I had received what I had requested despite being shown my email stating the contrary Accessing the hotel requires passing through the pub which is problematic when the pub is closed in the morning After leaving the hotel in the morning around 8 00 to go to an ATM I had to knock at the door and wait for the staff to let me back in The free wifi requires entering your mobile number and waiting for a code this doesn t work with a tablet or laptop We saw that the staff had attempted to acquire the code for another customer but the effort was not successful </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> We only stayed here one night as I had booked somewhere else a while ago and my flight was cancelled But honestly wish I had found this hotel first The staff were amazing they went above and beyond We stayed in the room with a separate floor for the bedroom and a living area The views where great over the canal it was hard leaving the room it was so amazing They knew how bad our trip was to get to Amsterdam so got our room ready fast and held out luggage for us We ate in the hotel restaurant just because it seemed silly to go anywhere else as it was packed and the food smelt good Considering my boyfriends a chef and hard to please he couldn t stop telling me about how great the food and kitchen was wish I had booked all our nights in Amsterdam here it was a great location I will 100 will come back and stay I m not one to leave reviews but this was worth it just to let other people know that you should stay here</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Thought that for the price there should have been tea coffe kettle in the room Expected the room to be more spacious We had to complain about the shower water temperature Extreme hot and extreme cold The staff gave us a more deluxe room on a lower floor The shower was better there We were satisfied However the staff said they knew about the issue So I don t think the hotel should be offering rooms at these prices when they know there is a problem with basic water temperature In our first room there was only one robe and slipper for two people In the second room there were no robes at all </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The hotel elevator was so small I could barely fit myself and my one piece of luggage a carry on roller bag However this is to be expected in an older building Just be aware if you have more than one piece of luggage and ask the staff to help you </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> This was a lovely little hotel off the Champs Elysee in a historic building This is not my favorite part of Paris as it s very touristy But if you want to be centrally located this hotel is a good value The room was a decent size for 1 2 people most older Paris hotels have tiny rooms nicely decorated and with a modern bathroom The hotel was walking distance to our Paris offices and the metro The staff spoke good English tolerated my broken French and were cheerful and helpful I would stay there again on my next business trip </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The hotel is beyond the zenith of its time The room we had would need some renovation works particularly in the bath room the tiles are starting to become lose The corridors are very narrow and at the time we stayed at the hotel the lift required some repair At arrival we found on a wood covered wall an imprint of what appeared to be the freshly creamed bottom of a previous guest Although we requested to have it cleaned this didn t happen </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very friendly staff the hotel was located close to Metro exit Argentine 2 minutes walk to Arc d Triomphe We had a welcome bar with some coffee and biscuits on arrival later we retrieved some sweets with our key which was nice The room was overall clean At this price the hotel was very good </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had one of the inner rooms on the 2nd floor I had asked for a quiet room Unfortunately the music from a party and from the bar was so noisy that we could not get to sleep Breakfast menu seemed a bit dated A wider range buffet style with more fresh fruit and veg would have made a big difference as opposed to the tired uninspiring English breakfast choices A more sumptuous breakfast would have justified the prices and upped the hotel to another category </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Staff were really helpful when we needed to change room due to noise from parties in hotel one of the breakfast orders was wrong but was rectified quickly and without any fuss Up to date tech facilities Wonderful bathroom facilities </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately the Ipod docking station did not work as the cradle was broken It was looked at but wasn t fixed which was a shame as we like to have our music on when we are getting ready Also Lancaster Gate tube station was closed which was a pain as it is 3 mins away from the hotel and perfect for getting into London Queensway was a good 15 minute walk </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is excellent The room was spacious and clean and although our room overlooked the main road we did not hear any traffic in the night or morning Also the porter remembered us which was nice as we always stay at this hotel when we are in London We hadn t been there for 3 years and they still remembered us We were very impressed </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Breakfast finish at 0900 which we and other guests found a little early for vacation makers Staff in the breakfast was so eager to clean and close In my view hotel will benefit a lot from Better hospitality communication skills and good old manners to match the great facilities they have Why not to get an old hotelier from a respectable hotel to train the staff </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Quiet location facing Barkson gardens small balcony refurbished new room of appropriate size for twin beds clean relatively spacious bathroom great fluffy towels bathrobes airconditioner quiet elevator available tea coffee facilities fridge with complimentary water only one bottle through for a twin room Excellent and highly recommended restaurant TheoSimplyItalian just next door was a discovery after all day Chelsea Flower show Restaurant is highly recommended for a supper or lunch with award winning chef doing reasonable priced Italian cooking Locals and Italians approve the food Try antipasti and hot starters Cook book is also available Hotel is close to the tube station 5 min walk </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was nothing my kid or I didn t like at the hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very helpful and pleasant reception staff Our trip to London was a birthday present for my daughter so the staff had the room decorated with balloons and put some nice presents for my kid The location of the hotel seems to be ideal All the major London sights are reachable by foot If you happen to fly via Gatwick Victoria station with its Gatwick Express is within a walking distance from the hotel Notwithstanding its central location the hotel is very quiet even for such a sensitive to noise person as I A separate praise goes to breakfasts The breakfasts are extremely good </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bath plug didn t work so no water drained away though this will be an easy fix for them Disappointed to not get a bottle of water included in the room for the price I ve stayed in several less luxury hotels and have always had a free bottle of water or two 4 is a bit of a rip off for 500ml </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Lovely hotel in a great location just up from the Marble Arch Comfy bed and good toiletries Nice chairs next to the sash window and a decent bowl of fruit Very modern and boutique with friendly staff </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Marble Arch by Montcalm boutique hotel is a gem of a hotel situated about 100 meters or so from the Marble Arch entrance to Hyde Park and equally close to the Marble Arch tube station It is within easy walking distance to the famous Oxford and Baker Street and a short uber hop to all of the more famous landmarks of London We stayed at the Marble Arch London for just over a week and were extremely happy with the hotel from the check in we were upgraded at no extra cost to the breakfasts to the overall friendliness of the staff The rooms were more than adequate considering this is London and space is a premium we were not cramped at all </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The attentiveness of the staff made our stay very special We wanted a special location for our anniversary milestone birthday where our family and friends could join us From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble Our room comfortably accommodated our Champagne reception before we enjoyed a fabulous lunch Since returning home our Grandaughter aged 5 has written in her homework journal that The Shard reaches up into the sky and it feels like being in the clouds It is amazing We think so too </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The staff were great The guy who showed us to our room was very helpful gave us information about nearby parking restaurants etc and generally very friendly The breakfast was decent most breakfasts aren t hot even though they re kept on hot plates but the food here was The best thing about this place is the location Some decent bars nearby train station right around the corner if you want to head in to central and plenty of fast food choices if you need a quick bite KFC Nandos Byron Burger King McD s more </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Booked a three bed room for me my wife and 21 year old son Got a two bed room with an additional camping bed suitable for a 10 year old child Complained after first night and got a new room suitable for three persons prior to third night However this room was freezing cold as heater was not started Went to sleep in a cold room but woke up pleasantly warm 4 th night was as it should have been from the start Still I was charged for a true three person bed room To summarize I paid more than I received and had booked</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Nice rooms Comfortable beds for two </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The staff didn t take the luggage to the room upon check in Sometimes there was someone at the door ready to open it for you as you leave the hotel Little tweaks to consistency required but overall a great hotel with capable staff </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The breakfast was spectacular The location to the train station was excellent and close to other amenities as well </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The view from the room was less than inspiring but if you don t expect to spend hours in your room staring longingly out the window this won t matter We knew the location when booking so spending a fair bit of time on the Tube to go anywhere did not come as a surprise </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable You get a lot for your money </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Offering but not delivering not considering customers needs just plain strange I booked room only but was offered a complimentary cream tea then it never arrived despite calling to chase I didn t even want it but they insisted on check in so I waited around for it Frustrating Any kind of tea never arrived and none in room Offered to have cream tea on my return from dinner at 11pm Asked twice to have breakfast as a substitute When I accepted I was told there was a 40 minute window on delivery Who has that time in the morning when on business to wait around for breakfast Also they do not notify when taxis turn up so you pay for the idling cost outside better to flag on the street </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The shower was difficult to work out even with instructions still didn t work properly It also wasn t very clean inside the shower with a build up of grime where the shower clearly hit the wall That people could easily see into our room unless the curtains were closed The staff on reception didn t have great knowledge of the area or services they were helpful in trying to find out but didn t give us the greatest of confidence </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Lady on check in was rude Lied to us about the suite we had booked I ve stayed at the hotel before Wifi didn t work throughout the bedroom as an international traveler I had to use my data roaming and have racked up a bill for that Shower was not clean Bed was half made when we got there TV broke at 11pm and whilst the technician did his best and did manage to fix it in about 10 minutes we had to get dressed and be inconvenienced whilst it was fixed Avoid this place like the plague I stay in at least one hotel a week and this was my worst experience in 2016 by far </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Stayed here twice in the past And thought I would be returning to a decently run and pleasant hotel in Battersea Unfortunately the stay was terrible</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The shower was very awkward I ended up scolding myself with hot water and all the staff could say we re we are sorry about that Due to running out of the shower we left the door open which triggered the smoke detector and someone called our room It then came to light half of the technical things such as out air con the lights and other things controlled by the TV weren t even working I didn t feel like the staff even cared about anything as they just said oh we will fix it at the mains and never called back to see if the problems were rectified </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> It was peaceful Room was a decent size and bed was comfortable</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I was majorly disappointed with this hotel I arrived and found my room to be really dirty There were stains on the carpet which you can accept in a hotel but what you can t accept is finding two hairs and a pubic hair in the bed and having a throw at the end of the bed which is COVERED in stains I felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the hotel after this The next morning I stepped into the shower and within 20 seconds it was overflowing water going all over the bathroom floor I had to turn off the shower and was unable to properly shower When I mentioned it to reception they said I had to left the drain up on the floor before I shower to allow the water to pass through I ve never stayed in a hotel in my life where I ve had to fiddle about on the shower floor lifting drains up before I shower and if this is the case provide me with instructions in the bathroom so I know to do this When I told reception I was unhappy with my room and it was unclean they said sorry No offer to reimburse me in any form Sorry doesn t really cut it </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> What did I like Nothing The mattress was too soft The room was small The bathroom wasn t overly clean The room has a smell of must damp </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room had no curtains and when reported they were aware of it but hadn t sorted it Many complaints and requests to speak to the manager were met with being told to please be patient I had to make some curtains out of a towel bed throw and coat hangers 100 a night for a room that makes Harry Potters cupboard under the stairs look palatial and to bring your own curtains value for money I think not I was informed the manager would contact my by Saturday afternoon 3 days later I m still waiting Some of the staff were rude and almost put out by my complaint a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry is not an acceptable way to treat paying guests This hotel has the potential to be a good one a shake up of staff and some lessons in hospitality and the rooms having the basics should help with that Do not be swayed by the photographs Photoshop has be put to good use here </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Smaller room than the photos on the web indicated Some clever photography techniques used Our room was on the 6th floor undergoing roof repairs my view was of tarpaulin and scaffolding I had asked at booking for a nice view as the trip was for my wife s birthday My request appears not to have been considered The room as very compact but the facilities listed were all found to be in place The television although having english speaking channels listed were not available The terrace was not available for use undergoing repairs On the 6th floor the lift could clearly be heard rumbling up and down </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> the normal double rooms are too small as in any central london hotels but the problem that its really depressing in colors and textures i recommend that you pay a couple of 10s GBP more and stay at the business rooms lifts are too small but again i had a stroller so am the one with a problem not them </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location is excellent cuz its in close proximity to everything the business grade rooms are spacious and conveniently designed staff are great and very helpful </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We choose a Cosy room because we didn t need much space and were planning to spend our time out and about We had seen the pictures and did appreciate that the bed was against the wall We didn t think this would be a problem but didn t appreciate that for the person next to the wall it would be difficult to get in or out of bed without disrupting the other My impression was that it was a single room with a double bed put in it Overall perhaps a little too small but that is our mistake we had seen the pictures D cor is showing signs of age throughout Largely well maintained it is showing its age as looking dated rather than poorly maintained or poor quality Gin Palace prices are a bit high at c 15 for a G T </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very very friendly staff great Gin Palace bar with excellent choice and service excellent location room and bathroom clean although bathroom showing wear and tear Good value stay for Central London in school holidays </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was only one lift that took you to the restaurant level and when we needed that lift at the same time as service staff members I felt judged I feel more training needs to be had on different Disabilities especially Invisable Disabilities </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> For the price the room was pretty standard I simply went to this hotel because of the location The staff were very helpful though </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Very comfortable beds excellent location 5 minute walk from Victoria tube station We told the hotel beforehand it was my birthday and were given complimentary room upgrade and drinks at the bar Also there was a birthday cake waiting for me in the room it was such a nice touch and all the staff were so helpful and nice Free wifi is available and our room had all the amenities we should need for a short stay with reception calling up after just 10minutes of arriving to check that everything was ok for us and to let them know should we need anything It was truly an amazing stay </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> In the evening prior to my departure I have asked the front desk to settle my account since I was checking out in the middle of the night I was told by the reception staff including the shift leader it could not be done When I checked out in the middle of the night the clerk could not issue the invoice as he was in the middle of the night process It is either they are using a very old software program or they could not do a very basic thing wich is done in any hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location could not be better Between Leicester sq to Piccadilly a minute from china town and the SoHo In minutes walk were theaters lots of restaurants and the underground The hotel was extremely comfortable and clean Staff were nice not always efficient I did not have breakfast at the hotel but there were lots of cafes around </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I did find that the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side for what was included Therefore i opted not to include with my booking instead visited different cafes that are located outside of the hotel every morning which was alot cheaper </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Absolutely loved staying in this hotel during my visit to Paris Literally no complaints whatsoever Fresh bedding on my super kingsize bed and nice smelling toiletries everyday The decor was beautiful which was a massive bonus aesthetically The hotel was central to all the major attractions i was interested in with the underground Metro just a few minutes walk from the hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The rooms are small we had a deluxe double which I believe is their equivalent of a standard but you can live with that because of all of the above Drinks and food in the hotel are pricey but you re not obliged to dine or drink there These aren t really negatives for us as the hotel is so close to restaurants and bars </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The service was excellent as well as the location Our room 412 had a gorgeous view over a courtyard The hotel staff placed macaroons and madelines in the room when we got there The beds are really comfortable and I know I ve said it before but genuinely the loveliest staff from the cleaners the bar tender to reception and concierge Cannot fault this beautiful hotel The hotel is a stones throw away from the Louvre and various other places such as Rue St Honore for restaurants and Rue de Rivoli for shopping Notre Dame is also not too far We had a lovely cocktail in the hotel bar served by a lovely and talented bar tender The hotel decor is clean and elegant </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The hotel was a old hotel sort of semi renovated But not to its best My bathroom was leaking sewage water from the upper floor at 5 am in the morning It s a good thing we were checking out that time as the receptionist doesn t seem to have a solution nor even a care or a apology for what happened Disappointing end to an average 3 star hotel not four There is minimal amenities in the bathroom rooms are very tiny the internet not fast The location of the hotel is right next to a subway stop but in hindsight I would ve stayed closer to an attraction rather than having to spend alot of time travelling as Paris is a large city </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Nothing everything was spot on </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Staff were all very welcoming and always willing to help ABSOLUTELY STUNNING VIEWS Room service was perfect lovely facilities modern calming and a perfect overall weekend Also a great location Me and my partner were staying in one of their stunning Executive rooms Absolutely amazing 24 hour views of the shard and more With both of us being 18 we didn t realize the policies on the rooftop terrace about needing to be 21 after 5 30 However we went up after 6 30 due to being invited for drinks by the hotel from a lovely hand written letter on arrival however due to staying on an executive floor they made exception for us to stay on the terrace for complimentary drinks and nibbles We tried various Cocktails and Mocktails over the weekend and they were all made to perfection Cannot wait to get back </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Rooms are too small which is normal in Paris but regarding to the old windows you will hear a lot of noise from outside Sofa bed is not comfortable and make a noise and in fact the 4 people apartment is suitable for 2 people The location is not very close to Metro and you have to walk 10 15 min </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I extended my stay which proved to be a bit of a challenge room card wasn t working and had to go down to reception 4 times to fix finally when it worked there was no electricity so had to go down to reception again Too much technology Quite frustrating when trying to get some rest On the last day I called to request a late check out as I needed some sleep they confirmed and I agreed on a price I was then abruptly woken up telling me that I have overstayed and needed to check out I explained again that I had let them know Staff definitely need to communicate more very unprofessional </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great location rooms very small but was expected Great beds very comfy Rooftop bar is great too </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> New hotel modern and well situated Free movies Free WiFi The bed was comfortable It has a dark screen to make the room really dark Personally this was my favorite thing </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Although we had checked the day before and everything was OK When we arrived Saturday we were told the rooms were double booked and the receptionist was uninterested in our problem The next 9 approx couples that arrived were all told the same The Manager wanted to ship us to a hotel the other side of London Only the fact they had debited my card the day before got them to put us in a sister hotel down the road The room was tiny By the time all this was sorted we missed the first 90mins of our concert I wouldn t be surprised if our original rooms were given to a wedding party at their neighbouring hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was ridiculously small we couldn t fit our bags in there with us it Was a joke I also didn t like that we seemed to become second class citizens when it was discovered that we booked through Booking com we were told that was the reason why we were not allowed to partake in breakfast even though I didn t enquire about it because I knew that it wasn t included in this booking it leaves an bad taste</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was small Had to dodge the tv to get round the bottom of the bed to get to the other side Was hard to use the trouser press as it was in a small cupboard wardrobe behind the coat hangers When checking in I asked for another key for my partner when he arrived to register which reception did and they said it would be waiting for him when he arrived When he arrived he was told there was no second key for him and that I already had one so it would be OK One key does not work </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The structure of the double bed was simply two single beds pushed together hence a bit uncomfortable in the middle On booking com there s a big tick next to Breakfast in the What s included section however upon arrival we found that it wasn t actually included Our room was on the ground floor and it was quite loud so we were woken up a few times in the night Also a bit stingy with the coffees teas etc in the room</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was very small for a 4 star hotel but I guess this is something common in Paris The sound proofing needs immediate improvement though The description states that the rooms are soundproofed but they were definitely not </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards offered us an excellent value for money ratio especially considering the fact that our stay was during the Easter weekend and that our tariff included breakfast The staff was courteous and helpful and we were very satisfied by the cleanliness of our room At walking distance from sights such as the Louvre museum and the Sacre Coeur Basilica but the real upside of the location is that just 100m from the hotel rue de Chateau d Eau you can find some really vivid restaurant bars where mainly locals go </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Problem with room door it wouldn t open at first when we arrived and when we left it alarmed as we hadn t pulled it hard to lock it Another guest said that he had the same problem with his door The hotel is new the receptionist said open 2 months so these are probably teething problems On the plus side it is reassuring that the door would alarm if tampered with </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The staff didn t really know what they were doing as it was a new hotel I can understand this The rooms are incredibly small and impractical For example the basin is so big but there is no benchspace to put your toiletries and there is no door on the toilet There is a door to the bathroom but it doesn t go fully to the ground which means the toilet lacks privacy The food from the rooftop restaurant was average One of the lifts wasn t working for our entire stay </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel is perfectly located in Shoreditch The rooftop terrace is a great place to have a drink </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> rooms are very small probably ideal for a singleton or cosy couple but I guess that s the charm of London I would love to smell a candle that was for sale in the room before buying it Maybe you could offer a mini sample in the room matchbox no mini danish pastries at breakfast buffet only regular size croissants and pain au chocolat available I would love something tiny to bite into with your coffee something small with lovely marmolade in or a fruit conserve etc I received a phone call at 9 30pm from reception concierge asking questions about the room etc I was actually asleep jet lag only arrived from Dubai so I found it disturbing then someone was knocking at the door I don t think that was necessary Receptionist apologized for this misconduct in the morning ITV player catch up TV didn t work and other channels were loading for a long time I am sure its not hotel s fault but worth checking connections etc Minor hiccups didn t spoil our overall experience though We love this hotel and have been returning at least once a year whenever in London </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Fancy lights in the bedroom my daughter called them disco lights beautiful set of body care products in the bathroom shower gel soap conditioner wonderful aromas modern design delicious farmhouse bread in breakfast buffet I wasn t charged for my daughter at breakfast which was a nice bonus We didn t go to Asia de Cuba for dinner this time but this is one of my very favourite restaurant in London and where the memories were made when I was dating my future husband 11 years ago </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room had a connecting door and I might as well have been staying with the person in the next room I heard every word of his conversation and his TV until 01 00 not good when you have to be up at 5 Need better sound proofing Why are biscuits for your tea a 1 a packet would expect them to be included </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Clean and staff friendly reasonable price The flats away from the main hotel are much nicer </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Old Space was poor especially with pull out bed open Shower is way to small unless you weigh less then 120lbs Almost got a splinter in my foot from the wood floors that should have been redone 50 years ago Microwave barely worked Was not comfortable for the amount I paid to stay there Then the front desk person when we were leaving was upset I wouldn t fill out a long survey in front of him while the taxi was waiting Then had to charge a minimal 22 Euro city tax on top of the large amount I already paid and wanted us to wait 6 minutes while the charge went through During all this the taxi is running a meter and we were charged 14 Euros higher then what was quoted I barely had enough Euro s left to cover it Bad ending to what was already a mediocre stay </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very close to everything Great location Front desk staff was mostly pleasant and spoke English ok </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The first room I had was tiny It was so hot I felt I couldn t breath Air conditioning noisy You couldn t open curtains I assume because window opened onto two huge pipes I asked to move rooms Was moved to a double room which was equally tiny but had a view The pictures of the rooms on the website do not reflect the actual rooms A very disappointing and expensive stay for the room </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We got a Club Level room which had a full bed in it While there was a built in closet desk area etc there was just no space to store luggage you couldn t walk around the parameter of the bed so both our suitcases were on the only opening of the floor Hard to navigate with two tall people Also unsure why there was no conditioner Our Paris hotel was the same don t know if it is a European Hotel thing so if you are used to using conditioner bring some with you </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location was amazing Noting Hill Portobello Street is a MUST This staff was helpful and very accommodating Our room was ready by check in time but others were not but they made sure everyone was comfortable at check in</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bed was a little bit too hard as a twin room we could have done with an extra hand towel and plug sockets next to each bed but otherwise the hotel itself was fab The location was a bit dirty and grubby and whilst fine to walk through during the day we didn t feel it would be safe in the evening to walk to the tube so got a taxi back</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel was lovely and clean The staff friendly and helpful the breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the room was very comfortable</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The price If i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but 170 is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for 22 it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money Completely mis sold and completely ripped off </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Unfortunately i struggled to like anything at a push i would say the check in staff and the guy that fetched me the iron ironing board even though that leaked water all over my clothes and the actual ironing board was wonkey i d have to say these were the only positives </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Dissappointed with check in I was charged the full room rate 199 as the male receptionist did not notice any different from my booking booking com price was 169 I was given no details about the time of breakfast or where it was and he gave us no directions of where to find the lifts or that we needed to use the room key to operate them We had parked our car almost right outside as we managed to get a space and we were quite happy to leave it there so I asked him if it was ok to park outside and he said parking is 18 even thoughBooking com says 14 and so I paid and he gave me an envelope and a receipt so the car could have valet parking which I was not interested in especially after having to pay 30 extra on the price of the room I half listened into the conversation of the people checking into next to me and they were dealt with much differently with more information Maybe the gentlemen that served me was new I mentioned it when I checked out the next day and the lady refunded the 30 for me Still a little annoyed about the unnecessary valet parking another unnecessary expense but hey ho </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Hotel was modern and quite nice Staff were professional and polite Doorman was fab Breakfast was delicious They organised some toothpaste for our room and arranged a cab for us to the O2 </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Wardrobe in bathroom clothes become damp with steam Difficult for a fairly small person to use soap and shampoo from fixed container when sitting in bath Hair Conditioner only in shower not in bath Location a disappointment booked it because website claims easy access to O2 We wanted to walk there and back Very disappointed at need for public transport or taxi It is a cruel and unfair claim even taxi driver asked if we had fallen for the hoax that the hotel is near O2 his very words Also directions from east India tube station needs to state which exit and which direction to take once you re going the right way they are accurate </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unknowingly I arrived on an event day at the stadium and the hotel has a strict local policy for parking on these days that was not really guest friendly especially when you have kids and lots of luggage But was eventually sorted out after speaking to the duty manager </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> New hotel building so room standards and set up was naturally expected to be clean and modern Front desk staff friendly and helpful McDonalds for kids Lidl Tesco and many local restaurant within walking distance </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The fact there was a noisy fan outside kept me awake half the night in room 402 Also when having a bath we were told that the water was going through the ceiling and down the walls in room underneath It must have been the overflow pipe not correctly plumbed as none had spilt over the edge </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were very helpful Also very near an underground and close to beautiful Hyde Park Clean towels each day and beds made nicely</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Upon check in in addition to taking the room charge up front they also took a pre authorization for damages that might happen We were not informed on this matter anywhere while we were making our reservation it is the hotel s responsibility to document and charge these damages not guests responsibility to pay up front for something that might happen They need to clarify their policies </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The rooms the amenities and the location were beyond our expectations and we truly enjoyed this hotel</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Limited parking spaces onsite enough for about 2 3 of the rooms at a guess we found a space but late arrivals may struggle otherwise a perfect hotel</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great service warm welcome and a free upgrade to a small studio suite The whole place was clean well maintained Parking on site and a district line tube station just a 3 minute walk away The area seemed lovely and friendly even when returning after midnight Lots of shops cafe s and quiet bars close to the hotel if you want an alternative to the super facilities offered by the hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was a little on the small side </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Staff couldn t be more friendly helpful and welcoming The hotel was spotlessly clean The location is very good on a quiet street but just a street away from shops restaurants and tube station A short walk to the bus stop too Despite the room being a little on the small side it was very well appointed and decorated to a high standard It had everything you could want just bijou The bathroom was not cramped often a problem when space is limited Nice big shower cubicle and very well laid out </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Staff is extremely nice Clean rooms Wifi and wired internet is good Cant tell about the food as havent used the restaurant Areas is very good very close to 2 tube stations and 3 different bus stops Parallel road has loads of different places to eat </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Everything has its price to the point that the room rate doesn t buy you a 4 5 experience you incrementally have to trade up to it From peanuts to toiletries to a film in your room everything costs slightly more than you feel it ought to Not permitting a burger to be served medium to adhere to a mysterious regulation is a little tiresome Nice team but ever so slightly commercial chain feel rather than boutique charm </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only downside to this hotel is its location it s a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube and there isn t a lot to see in the area In saying that it would be ideal if you needed to be in the City for whatever reason and if you re happy to take a cab then the proximity to the tube is irrelevant </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Everything else is great Every staff member we encountered was professional friendly and helpful The former brewery setting is beautiful and while accessing your room may necessitate the negotiation of a simple maze of hallways this only adds to the character Our room was clean comfortable and equipped with everything that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre Overall we had a great experience and would certainly return </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Located in Paris Golden Triangle and just a block from the Champs Elysees the location was absolutely fantastic Great restaurants shops and a metro station are all within a short walking distance from the hotel The hotel is aging but full of charm and well maintained Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated Loved the balcony and the view A big thank you to the front desk staff who were wonderful accommodating and always so friendly They really made our stay very enjoyable and we look forward to staying here again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> This hotel is dirty and multiple rooms are bug infested My bed had many bugs in it I got horrible bites all over my face and on my back only from being in this bed for about 15 minutes before I saw the bugs The toilet jammed almost every time I flashed spilling water on the bathroom floor Wi fi in rooms not working no reach The rooms as well as the lobby are dark and depressing hotel staff does not speak sufficient English language to help the guests with many simple issues The experience from day 1 was very aggravating and disappointing I was Paris in business attending important event and meeting many business partners Too bad I had to attend all meetings with burning red swollen face from the bugs bites Disgusting and unbelievable I would like this review to be a warning to other people considering their stay at Villa Lutece bugs were found in more rooms another colleague who was staying in a different room on a different floor was bitten too This is below any standard and the 4 stars which this hotel claims are absolutely not deserved and do not reflect the reality </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Very comfortable and clean room Secure off street car parking with instant access to hotel so getting things out of or putting them back into the car again was easy Very short walk to Port De Versailles exhibitions location plus Metro system tram right outside foyer also handy for car exit entry to main circular road artery around Paris Efficient taxi calling too and bar What more does the Business Traveller need </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> 1 Star is more than enough for this hotel We arrived me and my husband around 1am and hadnt be late we were to leave to another hotel The second we opened the door it stank of mold and dirt Room 103 hadnt been cleaned for decades everything stank even the bed sheets there were fliplops on the floor from previous guest and floor was covered with white bits The biggest surprise was the Filthy bathroom where there was urine spots on the stool Floor dirty and shower all stained we ended up sitting the rest of the night we couldnt touch anything didnt even take our shoes off Simply Disgusting </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> nothing that we didnt expect it is not a four or five star establishment and it doesnt pretend that more than budget hotel quaint and just fine would definetely go back</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> very close once you find the exit from Paddington Station unpretentious outside but inside small lobby rooms were small its London but not too tiny but pretty nice classic dark mahogani style wood beds were soft bit still surprisingly comfortable we slept well Breakfast had a good selection and thought its worth it clean rooms and friendly staff</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The toilet did not flush properly Hot water ran out in the morning We could hear everything from the couple above us and they would arrive every night at 3am and loudly talk and bang things till 5 am which meant we were forced to complain to the reception and they said they would try to solve it nothing happened to solve it The breakfast we paid for consisted of croissants that were gross and the yogurt that was sick So we never had breakfast at the hotel again </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> the only drawback is a breakfast it is very good but not as amazing as in George V or others equivalent ones while it is still quite expensive They should decrease price or increase quolity mean variety </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I am rearly writhing a review but this hotel worth it I ve stayed before in other 5 stars Paris hotels and some was great but crazily expensive others just good with acceptable prices but this one combines both I guess that manager of this hotel should be a perfectionist everything is on a place everything created with a thought of beauty and comfort Truly 5 star hotel Totally recommend </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Contemporary design and smart rooms I loved this futuristic hotel Minimalist rooms without extra space but with all bells and whistles are entirely controlled with an i pad You can even decide how you want your room to feel selecting the mood from the i pad I found extremely interesting the list of all the alternative attractions and restaurants recommended by other guests that you can find scrolling on the i pad The position is ideal to visit the city and to have a great nightlife Shoreditch is particularly recommended to young people it has been subject to considerable gentrification in the past years with accompanying rises in interesting restaurants and bars try Cream for breakfast two minute walk from the hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> quality of the room was nothing special Food was terrible poached eggs with my starter still had runny whites no one likes that burger was too hot to eat but the fries were only just warm how do they do that No table check in fact no service at all for over 45 mins as the staff were too busy no drinks offered no puds or coffee offered I had to chase to pay breakfast was way over priced self service rubbish buffet style with everything cold half a cup of coffee offered after 20mins you get a better service at premier inn for a lot less Why can hotels not go back to the days where a chef actually cooks your breakfast and it s hot This is the hotels last opportunity to impress a guest it s the last thing we remember they should make the effort would not use Hilton again </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> not much really location as it was close to where I needed to be but no parking and way over priced </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> From the moment we arrived we knew we were going to have a fantastic weekend We arrived early to check in and our room wasn t ready but we were assured that it would be worth the wait as we had been given a complimentary upgrade Later in the evening there was an issue with our room and so without question we were moved again to an even better room which was absolutely fantastic The staff couldn t have been any more helpful throughout our stay restaurant recommendations were great delicious breakfasts at the hotel we couldn t have wished for a better hotel stay Location is fantastic for the museums the hop on hop off bus stops just outside and Gloucester road tube station a 5 minute walk away </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Our only disappointment was the size of a family room 3 adults when sofa bed made encroached into the room leaving a difficult route to the bathroom also we all found the pillows too hard would have been nice to have had a choice </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great location very professional staff didn t need to ask anything all the information given at check in spotlessly clean everything we needed in a family room Would definitely stay again </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The staff were fantastic we asked to change room as my little one didn t like the 28th floor and it was no problem at all John the housekeeper introduced himself and made sure we were all ok We arrived in the evening and by the time we had checked in it was dark so the Eiffle Tower was lit up The hotel looked out onto the river and just a Minute or two to walk the base of the Eiffle Tower where music and street markets made it an amazing evening </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Construction site in the middle of the hotel Entrance blocked by trucks And this comes at 900 pounds plus plus all taxes etc THAT WAS A RIPP OFF ORGANISED BY THEM AND YOU </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> You did not tell me that they are undergoing a major renovation The entrance was a construction site They claimed you were informed and you have to announce it on time of booking But you did not I think you are the guilty party not them</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was a huge mass of hair in the bath plughole gross only found because the plughole was blocked I did mention this to the concierge upon our checkout but the gentleman merely shrugged and said sorry but offered nothing by way of compensation The distance to the room was extremely long and we shown a further access route with suitcases wasn t greatly appreciated </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The bed was amazing and the room was lovely didn t bother keeping the dressing gowns at 90 each a little bit extortionate Loved the breakfast gorgeous </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The first night we got a so called update of our room but it was a room without heating ice cold no view at all We called the housekeeper at 11 p m The whole part of the hotel in which was our room was non heated in november in London When we asked them to check the heating the only proposal was to give us a portable heating for the night So we asked to change the room next morning and then we got finally a nice room </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had a party of 20 booked in to the SkyLounge for lunch and it was really really disappointing The staff were lovely but totally overstretched The food was disappointing Caesar salad a romaine lettuce sliced in half and sprinkled with a hard boiled egg and some dried up chicken Long long wait for drinks which arrived in fits and starts We had booked in advance and therefore the size of the party was known before we arrived I do feel that if a restaurant can t cope with a large party size they should say so </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Rooms and room facilities were just what we expected although one of the rooms was an internal room and very hot Reception staff were lovely and very helpful Location and views are good </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Check in was chaotic rooms weren t available even though we explained out tight schedule and requested an earlier check in We were asked to come back at 3pm but at 3 15 our rooms still not available we were once more asked if we could come back later they would phone us when rooms ready After our protests a manager managed to locate another available room this was good but unfortunately it was 3 floors away from the other Bar staff were quite unhelpful rude almost when we asked what beers were available One doesn t expect to have the fridge doors flung open and contents pointed at as a response to a simple question </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Break fast was good the staff were attentive and helpful Friendly efficient staff when we left our luggage for safe keeping on Sunday after check out Hotel has a very good location </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Georges was the only reason I cannot give this place 10 out of 10 He didn t want to renew our wifi for us after the 3rd day when we were checking out the following day That day was the most essential looking for flight times taxis check ins etc He made it very difficult for us to get all our departure needs straightened out We had to ask 4 times and he only gave us one for 3 people to share We paid for this night as well so why was he being so difficult To add to the insult he failed to call me a taxi at 4 30 am After I asked twice When I came down he said I didn t need to leave this early I explained I wanted to be early and he continued to argue with me Finally he told me to stand outside near the metro for at the taxi stand I am a 33 yr old woman alone who didn t want to be outside by myself at 4 30 am Another concierge from another hotel helped me and called a taxi He was the most pleasant person and helped me when I was afraid and nervous about my flight The taxi he provided charged me 30 to Orly when Georges told me 60 Was he trying to rip me off Why was this man so awful He truly destroyed our end experience in Paris </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location was great and the bathrooms were big and very clean The free wifi for each guest was an added bonus The hotel itself is pretty and a great place to stay Dean was amazing and the most accommodating concierge He put the standard or expectation so high it was difficult to expect any less </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We booked a 2 night stay at this hotel 3 months in advance for the opening game of the Rugby World Cup With 3 weeks to go we were told there had been an admin error and they were moving us to the Novotel for just the opening night not very helpful who wants to move hotels on a 2 night stay They then decided we were allowed to stay but removed the complimentary breakfasts we had been offered which considering the amount of stress and phoning other hotels I had to do following their admin error I didnt think was great customer service </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was small but that is to be expected in London The photos make it look bigger than it actually is The bed and pillows are also incredibly uncomfortable and we are normally not picky at all </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is perfect and the room was very clean It is very close to the tube train station as well which is great Our room faced a back street so it was very quiet The staff were also very friendly We didn t have the breakfast but there are so many cafes in the surrounding area so it wasn t necessary </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> They said the bar was closed at around 11pm but you could still order beer or wine Didn t bother us but strange you could only order certain drinks Barman on this particular evening didn t seem to have much of a clue what he was doing to be honest However by no means an issue and didn t detract from a lovely stay </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location was fantastic and the reception staff couldn t have been any more helpful Enjoyed the boutique quirky feel about the hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Location worked well for us being near to Victoria station yet a reasonable walking distance to Westminster South Bank etc Pimlico is nearest tube station maybe 5 minutes walk Smart looking interior good use of space in the lobby small bar and three small lounge areas Friendly staff no problem storing luggage either if arriving early or leaving late </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The room was big enough because in London you shouldn t expect the big rooms if you only take a standard room The breakfast was superb yoghurt variety of fresh fruit bread pasteries The staff was very friendly We had 4 dinners within 5 minutes walk max 400 meter from the hotel and they were all great and with good price cool extras like newspapers and magazines wifi </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Shower cubicle was small and screen leaked all over the floor so had to lay down towels to soak up water Eggs Benedict was considered a Premium Breakfast item so wanted to charge 9 50 on top of what I had already paid for breakfast Aside from a muffin and spoon of sauce the egg and ham was already laid out for standard breakfast so did feel this extra charge was unnecessary </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Staff were friendly and attentive Location was good but road where hotel was could do with a tidy up as lots of litter so not the most attractive street in London</Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Loved the Jazz Club Great entertainment Went with my grandson and he really enjoyed the location the food the room was very comfortable The breakfast was wonderful This was my second visit to this hotel and I will return again at my next opportunity The restaurants near the hotel were as good as I remembered from my last visit The hotel was very helpful in making sure that we got the twin beds that I was concerned about I called Booking com practically every day before this trip and was told that I could only find out when I checked in whether I could have a twin room or not This aggravation was unacceptable In future I will use a travel agent </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The Hoxton is an extremely cool East London hipster hotel and hang out We loved everything about it from the cozy areas to sit and read a book to the delicious food from the Hoxton Grill the old skool photo booth and of course the amazingly squishy beds The room was on the smaller side but everything about it was great The whole experience felt personalised to us and they even left a Happy Birthday balloon for my boyfriend in the room The bathrooms are lovely and the shower was big hot and powerful You get a little breakfast included in the price which got delivered to our door at the chosen time a nice little touch There are little quirks all over the hotel and the staff are a very friendly bunch We loved everything about this place and would highly recommend it </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I booked the room for a couple myself and my wife but there was only one bath towel and one hand towel in the bathroom The bath towel had a dirty mark on it so that was a bit off putting We didn t ask for another towel just made do as our visit was such a short one </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location of the hotel was perfect for our purposes The desk clerk was friendly but it took him some time to find our booking although we gave him all our particulars </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bathroom sink leaked the shower water was cold the first night and if someone walked upstairs it sounded as if the roof was coming down Also beware that there is no alcohol served in this hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Friendly and accomodating staff Great features such as a warm welcome with some complimentary beverages The price of food was very readonable Beautifully designed spaces Huge bonus They provide a free smart phone with free calls to the US and a few other countries and free internet for the length if your stay The mini bar is also complementary </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Hotel was within easy walking distance to Gare Du Nord train station The room decor was very modern trendy which gave the room a nice upscale feel very trendy The room we were in was a Jr Suite It was very roomy for the three adults in our party It had one large bed I believe it was a king and a couch sofa bed which was rather comfy The bathroom was quite large due to rainfall shower setup no shower doors While the shower setup was very nice it did leave the surrounding bathroom floor quite wet so some we had to mop it up after each use One of the best features of the hotel was its super close proximity to the Poissonniere Metro subway stop The stop was literally right outside the hotel door It wasn t a busy stop so people and traffic noise were quite low Several nice Cafes were in all directions as were a number of convenience stores for wine water snacks etc The front desk staff were very nice helpful We were able to store our luggage after we checked out while we did some final exploring before our train to London A small refrigerator was in the room which was nice to keep water drinks food chilled There was also a coffee machine in the room Keurig like but ours did not function well The bath towels were very large and plush but the bed pillows were a bit soft for my taste The hotel did offer breakfast but we thought it was a bit pricey so we did not take advantage of it </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I read other reviews and they all said the same thing this is not a 5 hotel I decided to judge for myself After a weekend stay I agree The welcome wasn t 5 nor was the overall service There were 2 staff members on the desk and that s all we saw They were polite which was nice but for over 200 a night I was expecting more We were shown to our rooms but no help with luggage etc We got to our room which was very clean and impressive Something that we weren t told beforehand nor upon arrival is that there is scaffolding up around the hotel exterior for the duration of our stay This was a bit annoying as the view is something that made me book this hotel There were no tea or coffee facilities either If this was advertised as a 3 hotel at a 3 price I d be over the moon It was however a 3 hotel at a 5 price I don t really write reviews but I felt this may be of some use to future guests if you re looking for a 5 hotel at a 5 price go with the big names That s what I think I ll do But hey it s only my opinion </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We loved the location Central to everything and a quick easy walk to the metro and simple for taxis to find The vintage look of the room was quite nice also </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Very noisy Lack of carpeting in the bedrooms mean that every journey made by the occupant of the room upstairs whether to the loo or what sounded rather like a body being dragged back and forth across the floor by an elephant wearing stilettos will be shared by you If you aren t bothered about noise the hotel is fine </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The milk for breakfast cereal was contained in tiny glass bottles Three needed for the average bowl and one would be kept waiting for full bottles to appear The other small grouse the four slice toaster inadequate for the job and far too small for the bread slices with one third sticking of the slice poking out and untoasted Otherwise first class with the staff always willing to oblige </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Our room was really comfortable and clean and the bed superb What else can you ask One minor grouse was the view Being at the rear of the hotel half of the view being a brick wall the other overlooking other dwellings hotels I suppose the good part of this being at the rear there was no major traffic noise </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The property is centrally located to many restaurants and attractions Hotel staffs do speak English and are very friendly and helpful We had visited Paris many times in the past and this hotel is the best one The Le Comptoir du Relais restaurant serves delicious food and it is part of the hotel The hotel receptionist can reserve it for you when you stay at this hotel Otherwise there is a long wait line even at 10 pm </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bed could do with a topper The breakfast was delicious and very good value but the area breakfast was served in was too tiny to offer a reasonable atmosphere it would almost be better to put one table and lots of chairs around it encourage travellers to share </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were very helpful and friendly definately going the extra mile and seemed genuinely focused on making sure their patrons had the best possible time The hotel is stuffed with gentle aristocratic charm and very elegant in a very unpresumptious way Fantastic quiet location so close to the centre </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> I love this Hotel Hotel Room Service The hotel itself is very cosy and comfy stayed in room 052 on the fifth floor and the room was beautiful and just like the pictures on the website comfy double bed Free WiFi size of the room was comfy specially in a city as Paris where rooms are tiny with a balcony just like I requested minibar espresso machine tea kettle with tea fresh complimentary water flat screen TV relaxing bathroom with all needed amenities Hotel was very quiet and relaxing at all times Room service was wonderful and kept my room super clean at all times Tried their laundry service and it was useful and they took care of my jeans despite me requesting for it late at night As I stayed there during Christmas I got a complementary bottle of Champagne on arrival I was given the choice between it and fruits of course I went with Champagne considering its Christmas in Paris as well as Chocolates on Christmas eve along with handwritten cards which I appreciated Staff absolutely wonderful staff special thanks to the wonderful ladies as well as Riza always willing to help English speaking very friendly professional and respectful always smiling they really were a pleasure to deal with and helped me many times Location great location right next to the Musee d Orsay few steps away from the RER the Louvre is around 5 7 mins walk away infact most touristic places are easily accessible from it wither by foot or RER Cabs can easily also reach it since its next to the muse d Orsay There are several restaurants and cafes and supermarket around it 2 3mins away so you have everything you need Breakfast I tried their breakfast twice and I enjoyed it yet keep in mind that the menu doesn t change Scrambled eggs sausage bacon croissants and bread Coffee Tea juices </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> This is a fantastic place to stay in Paris In fact it s the best hotel I have stayed in so far in Paris and I have been here many times Spotlessly clean room comfortable bed and very quiet Friendly staff This place is great when you have a conference in Palais de Congres but also close to Arc de Triomph Public transport will bring you anywhere from here For great Italian dinner go to La Casa Di Sergio just down the road at 77 Avenue des Ternes Airport bus from CDG stops just around the corner </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> I fully enjoyed my view from the requested high level room I was also Impressed with the toiletries provided and the bed was extremely comfy </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> We genuinely loved everything Firstly the Spanish girl on reception who checked us in was wonderful and welcoming we discussed some places I had travelled in Spain and the foods and then the fresh home made Sangria that was on the reception desk and our love of Spain s culture and scenery I explained it was my birthday and we needed a late checkout and after a brief discussion with her colleague we were blissfully granted an upgrade to a more spacious room as a treat from the hotel Wonderful The room was very smart and the shower was amazing but what we loved most was the original art that decorated all the corridors if we had more time we would have viewed them all as the hotel could humbly compete with many an art gallery Of course the hotel was also beautiful throughout </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The restaurant was abismal Staff were rude and ignorant Didn t feel like we were treated as paying guests we were spoken to like riff raff just off the street A sign was up to say restaurant open at 11 30 we waited half an hour until 25 to 12 just to be very rudely told that it actually wasn t open until 12 The waiter was visibly looking down at us I felt like I wasn t really welcome there We reluctantly returned the next day after 12 to grab a quick lunch which turned into a 50minute wait for a salad and a burger Guests who came in 15 20mins after us were being served and there was food lying on the kitchen counter very much resembling a salad for over 25mins which was ready to be served when I questioned the wait on the food I received a rude response saying a group which had made a reservation at 8am that morning were in so that s why there is a long wait First of all we were not made aware of this before ordering Secondly if the group had made a reservation surely the staff should have been much more prepared for this Thirdly just because there is a group of people who made a reservation that should not mean that 2 people wont get their food for almost 1hour I was absolutely appalled by the service or lack there of It has completely put me off returning to this hotel and will be sure not to recommend to anyone </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only bad thing about this hotel is its location whilst it says it s only a 15 minute tram ride away that s a bit of a fib You can get the 18 and 2 tram to the centre and they both take at least 30 minute which we didn t mind but if you want to be close to the centre this probably isn t the best choice </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Amazing hotel Absolutely loved how clean comfy and stunning the rooms and the hotel itself actually were can honestly say it is one of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed in </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The location was further than expected although it was was easy to get to the center of Amsterdam by train The price was a bit too high for the room service and the restaurant The surrounding area was not so pleasant as it was located next to a construction site </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Decent hotel with everything you need with friendly staff and quick service Everything was very clean and neat It was perfect for a short stay getaway with a short distance to the city center </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The bathrooms have no hooks to hang used towels which was slightly inconvenient We also had some problems after our first night with the cleaner obviously not being aware of what their job entailed the hotel only opened three days earlier so I expect this will improve The big pillows in the beds are lovely for sitting up to read or watch TV but I would have welcomed smaller extra pillows for sleeping to be made available as well </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff was lovely and very helpful Breakfast was excellent The beds were comfortable and the room was lovely Our bedroom had windows that open radiator you can control yourself and heavy blackout curtains Very nice newly refurbished bathrooms </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The lack of Internet service complimentary with room fee was just wrong We found out a person can come off the street sit at the bar and use the Internet for no charge while those of us who actually purchased room s were charged 10 day We actually sat in the bar and lobby and used the free access the second night </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We loved the young man in concierge He was so helpful in planning our short stay of 2 days so that we got thee most of the lovely city of Vienna He showed us all the places to stop and where we were on the map so our stay was much more enjoyable </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Everything was awesome with this hotel The only thing that could be improved was really a small thing The WiFi was fast but every time you left the hotel and if you were up after midnight the system would kick you off and you had to go back through the registration again It was not a huge deal except for the fact that the user id was a totally random 9 character id and the password was another random six character password It was so random that it took me a few days to even get close to memorizing it even though I had to enter it about four times per day This would in no way keep me from staying at this hotel but just a very very VERY small item that kept it from absolute perfection </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately I got bed bugs during my stay The bites showed up the day I left and they proceeded to get worse as the week went on until I finally went to the doctor s and was diagnosed It s a shame too because the hotel seemed lovely I had noticed several other types of bugs ones the eye could see obviously and was able to eliminate them myself I thought about asking for another room but convinced myself there was nothing to worry about Thus unfortunately I would not recommend this place until they have resolved the problem </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff was very helpful and polite The hotel is conveniently located near a tram stop that takes you to the center of town writhin 10 minutes You can also reach the airport relatively cheaply using this method Simply take tram 5 to the Zuin stop and hop on the metro you may pay 3 and then take either platform 3 or 4 to the airport you can follow the indicators on the signs </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The television was a nightmare to work The bathroom although very nice had sloping ceilings so banging my head was a regular event and we stayed for 3 nights and were only provided with the complimentary toiletries on the first night which wasn t very good as we had paid for 3 nights The hotel has a beautiful seating area and restaurant but does not offer meals other than breakfast </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel was beautiful and the staff were all fabulous helpful and really friendly Our room was spacious tastefully decorated and really comfortable overall Tea making facilities and bottled water were very welcome The hotel was in a very quiet location and close to the trams </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We were charged 7 50 for a small bottle of water from the minibar When we complained about the ridiculous charges especially as there was no complimentary water we were told that the water in Amsterdam is clean enough to drink from the tap Which of course we didn t know One of the lifts didn t work during our stay which meant that we had to wait for a lift 10 15 minutes each time we needed to use it There were no stairs for alternative </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There were no cups in the room for tea and coffee only paper cups which is not good enough for a four star hotel environmentally unfriendly and burn your hands if you like hot tea Only one small pillow each The choice of tv channels for the kids was poor only Bbc news There was quite a bit of noise from the band upstairs although it ended fairly early The walls were thin and shook whenever a door slammed closed The cooked breakfast was cold and inedible Making a cup of tea at the buffet was difficult as they only had coffee machines and hot water the cold milk wasn t near the tea and coffee had to hunt around for it Novotel hotels are clearly not for me no feeling of value for money for the 213 euro charge per night</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel was close to the sagrada familia the pool was ok but cold The views were good room was basic but clean Good customer service staff very helpful Good choice of food at breakfast buffet</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Where to start first of all this is 3 star service at best not 5 star but you still pay 5 star prices The staff is untrained not welcoming at all the reception supervisor is simply rude at one point he even hung up the phone on us The elevators are painstakingly slow most guests simply start using the stairway out of frustration even when staying at the top floors that s how slow they are The rooms are not quiet at all the building is designed in an L shape with the pool and main restaurant right below creating a constant noise of either dining or swimming hotel guests or both The glass sides of the shower cabin in the bathroom are not fully waterproof leaving a puddle of shower water along the toilet the whole day Toiletries are not replaced on a daily basis and to top it all off the complementary water is only offered at the day of check in And then lastly we first got charged 100 EUR more upon check out check your bill before paying </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I was waiting to get checked in for 15 minutes because there was only one guy at the counter so people were lining up The bed didn t sleep well and I ordered a double bed but got twin beds The chicken wings in the restaurant were dry The street is very noisy and keeps you awake and wakes you up again The fridge in the room only has 2 bottles of water The elevator takes ages when you call it The lobby is always boiling even when outside is cooler </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> They lost our booking through you I had e mailed them that our trip had changed and we would only be there 1 night instead of two Pre paid for two of course I understood no refund but asked for maybe an upgrade to our room They found the reservation and agreed We would have a nice room It was no better that our two other visits In fact was smaller Construction going on for a remodel project Like the location and service but this time it was not good and would make me not go next trip to Barcelona</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> All of our party 6 adults all agreed that despite a good selection of food the buffet breakfast was spoiled by virtue of the hot food not being kept warm enough in the respective trays etc Overall the service in the restaurant was poor Upon leaving and settling our accounts payment for the dinner on our first evening was still outstanding despite the fact we had all paid cash This was eventually accepted by the management </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough especially if you have young kids The staff were incredibly friendly We were always greeted with a smile and help at the front door given we ve 2 children under 2 Anytime we requested anything the staff attended to it instantly and would always come to our room to attend to our requests The cot provided was clean and new hotel is well located to great tapas bar and las ramblas It is a bit of a walk approx 45 1hr to the beach however this ended up working great for our toddler as he slept during the siesta walk And less than 10 euros if you catch a taxi The amenities are great Very family friendly </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Great location of the hotel easy accessible by car and underground parking arranged by hotel The food and roof top pool are a great value in the hot August summer We traveled through Barcelona by our own car and this was very easy to do The location is great because it is out of the over crowded touristic area and located in a more quiet clean and beautiful neighbourhood Staff was super helpful and the comfort of the room was great </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The bed was extremely comfortable Nespresso pods and machine in the room a welcome edition Both a walk in waterfall shower and a bath available The room was fairly quiet especially after 9 30pm which made for a great night sleep The hotel decor is on point with a wide variety of indoor plants and seating areas The Food Hallen next door is the cherry on top </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We loved everything Just a little tip to guests who intend to rent the bikes the ones at the hotel don t come with a lock A very kind receptionist employee however informed us that we can reserve bikes with them via a local Bike Shop which gives you a 10 discount So we paid 9EUR per person for 4 hours of exploring the city on bikes with locks </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is superb A short minute walk to Las Ramblas and Placa de la Catalunya About a 20 25minute drive with the Airport Shuttle from the Airport and the bus stops a 3 minute walk away from the hotel The staff was extremely welcoming and very helpful for us to find our way around The rooftop bar was also great with nice music and cozy atmosphere We had a standard double room which was very spacious and tidy We would definitely come back here again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room I booked for the family wasn t within my expectation as I booked for five persons but room was too small for five with only one bathroom If I knew the size of the room is too small I could have taken 2 rooms instead l highly suggest hotel management to allocate adequate room for large family Otherwise the hotel is super excellent </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Bathroom did not have heating Beds pillows could be more comfortable for a 4 star hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> LOCATION is really really nice Loved the fact that when you inserted card key inside the room a signal outside would light up indicating to staff that room is occupided helps avoid disturbances and embarassing situations Free biycle rentals I think they only have 5 Mifi rentals 5 5 Euros Most hotels do not offer mifi this hotel did which was GREAT for somene like myself visiting Europe Hotel looks lavish when you walk inside Makes a good impression Bathroom comes with a lot of things like razor and razor creame tooth brush Bathroom shower shoots our high presssure water at diff areas </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> It was just the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in from start to finish On arrival we were greeted by the ever so welcoming gentleman with a beard who my husband said several times just could not do enough We received some very lovely treats for the kiddies which made them feel very special Our room was split level which generously provided excellent accommodation for us a family of five We totally adored the decor in the breakfast room it was so trendy and the lovely lady there assisted kindly in helping make a wonderful coffee The staff were so pleasant The location is just so so so so excellent when visiting Barcelona We had a window overlooking the little street just off la rambla and we were directly across the street from the busiest market in Barcelona which was pure class My husband needed to book accommodation for the following night and a few other bits and bobs before our departure and the girls on reception was most helpful Wonderful to meet such nice staff in such a busy city It was the best location for shopping site seeing strolling down la Rambla etc We just loved it and will be back If only it had been the 1st of July and all the sales would have started Overall 10 10 well Excellllleeeennnnttttttt</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Cleanliness wasn t good at all you can see accumulated dust under beds once the maid came to clean the room and there was someone in it she putted new towels and didn t come back to clean when the room was empty and we wasn t sure that towels were changed everyday and we paid some of the amount by credit card and we were surprised that someone took the next day an amount of money from my credit card without my agreement so I was obliged to stop my credit card and to change it when I came back to lebanon </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> No restaurant for dining in Rooftop bar was disappointing closed at 9pm and swimming pool area therefore was dark and uninviting after this time The coffee at breakfast was a severe let down and expensive Single rooms have no view and are compact </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location to metro station was convenient as this area is not as densely filled with restaurants as Las Ramblas so you will need to commute often to main attractions</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> the location might be good for attending exhibition to Fira otherwise public transport connection is not enough there is one one bus and frequency is every 30 min and to the nearest Metro station takes about 7 10 minutes to walk Breakfast should have a bit different I stayed there for 7 nights and every morning had the same breakfast some dry salami look dry and pretty old</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> staff are very nice and helpful that make you feel comfortable and welcome airport pick up is the advantage and follow the G which is for hotel parking very easy to find</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Our stay was great but had a little issue with the temperature of the room We stayed on the hotel in early March with the high temps around 65 F 17 C but when we initially walked into our room it was about 85 F 29 C We turned off the heat but we still had to keep our window open the entire 3 day stay so it was a little noisy at night The hotel is in a busy area with lots of noise in the street sidewalk but not sure if it would have been noisy with the window shut </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very nice fairly inexpensive hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona Great location to tour Barcelona as long as you don t mind walking a few blocks to get to the Metro or to see the many sites that we consider to be within walking distance There are many restaurants and stores within walking distance The hotel is just a few steps from the Barcelona Cathedral and a few blocks from Las Ramblas The room was not big but not too small with a nice size bathroom Staff was pleasant and very helpful We requested an early check in and we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to get into our room before 11 00 am </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Transportation to the airport It is not like hotels near by Placa di Catalunia which you can go with 1 bus to the airport There is no one direct bus driving you to the airport from this hotel or near by You have to chage buses while you carry your laggage It is hard way So I took a taxi </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Hotel was dated Our room door could of done with a new lick of paint and was narrow compared to other hotels we have stayed in I paid nearly the same price in Tokyo and the hotel rooms was far more nicer Rooms are fairly small for the price Bathrooms you couldn t swing a cat in Ordered a baby cot when on booking but when we turned their was no cot in room When we enquired they said you need to order on booking They said they would get one from another hotel but girl on reception seemed reluctant and she had a attitude the cot delivered wasn t a cot it was a play den Hotel lifts were VERY small and slow In general we will not be staying here again for 200 night Worst hotel ever A depressing return to the UK </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We stayed in a room with two double beds family of 4 children aged 14 and 11 Beds were far too soft ended rolling together and aching back Too many large scatter cushions with no where to put them except the floor making an obstacle course Bathroom far too small for four people and no where to hang towels Looked like someone had tried to open the glazing to open a window in order to smoke as the glazing was loose and cigarette ash between glazing and window sill Good breakfast but thought the set up of large dinning room felt like a residential home for the elderly </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were extremely polite Swimming pool very nice good choice at breakfast Easy location </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately there were a few things that need improvements 1 Upon arriving the receptionists could not locate our invitation although we presented our booking confirmation 2 Maybe that s why the room included only 2 towels when we just arrived and no floor mat for the bathroom 3 The bed was really really uncomfortable and both of us suffered back pains 4 No refrigerator in the room 5 No hair dryer and minimal toiletries soap bar and shampoo no conditioner body lotion and so on 6 Food is reasonable not enough vegetables and bad coffee 7 We selected the holiday Inn thinking we can add this stay to our holiday inn card unfortunately we found out that it cannot be added when ordering through booking com </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> 1 The staff was very polite and helpful Everything we asked for missing towels extra pillows help with the TV was answered very quickly 2 The location is very convenient not in the center but 2 minutes the Russell Sq station 3 There s a nice shopping center 2 minutes from the hotel with stores supermarket post office and restaurants </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The breakfast is too simple and it is not worth the value of money as you pay for a four star hotel with a 2 or 3 star hotel s breakfast </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The room is spacious and it is a walking distance to some attractions in Milan like Church of San Bernardino alle Ossa the art pieces are made from skull and bone Milan catherdal Duadrilatero Della Moda etc You may keep the luggages at hotel s lobby after checking out if you still want to wander around the town before leaving Milan </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> This would be outside the hotels control there is some building work adjacent to the hotel and the workmen make a lot of noise very early However just meant we had more time to enjoy the city </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The very central location of the property Spacious very friendly staff and all we met couldn t do more to help us feel very welcomed It was a wedding anniversary weekend and this was recognised by the team which was very considerate by a simple note and two lovely amazing pastries Breakfast was super as were all the staff from Kieran on reception to the folks in the restaurant The view we had overlooking Dam Square was brilliant </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The construction and renovations were terrible we had to take two elevators and walk a long winding narrow and dirty hallways to reach our room on the second floor It is like a maze we followed the arrows to the Urban Wing every time we came in and got out to the street It was depressing Had we known that we would not have made reservation at this time with this high price of 250 night </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It seemed from the add at bookin com that breakfast was included suggesting it as a special offer it was on our checking out that we understood it was not the case NEVER were we told about the price for breakfast we didnt ask as we thought it is included and never was it mentioned that it is not included and whilst checking out we understood this was the case the staff at reception said they have mentioned it before which was not the case and the whole discussion was not in the lovely spirit of the hotel at all otherwise the hotel was lovely and it was a pity </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> States non smoking but guests were smoking and you could smell it The room size was poor and the bed size requested was wrong I asked for a twin room with two single beds and ended up with a double bed and a single at the bottom of the bed which I kept bumping into as it was in the way Bath was dirty so as stayed for one night did not use it Grouting around bath was very poor standard and I stayed at the hotel Amsterdam next door but one two weeks previous and that was cheaper and was a much better hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> 1 The always blocking locking keys we were staying for sometime and not for the first time and they re always a big problem they randomly stop working or allow You to enter places You shouldn t be in 2 Clarity and intentions of some of the staff could use an improvement This was the last trip of mine to Amsterdam without the magical card 3 I wish I parted ways in a more friendly manner with the management of the hotel</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> As always the meals were fantastic most if not all of the staff was very supportive they understood and listened to the customers that would be me needs I always recommend Jaz Amsterdam but would advice to plan in advance that way You get the best of the best worlds Also if You plan on seeing the City it s good to take more nights as it s not mentioned but longer stays give You reductions and que free experiance of stuff like Adam Lookout or Madam Tussauds </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Parking is available on sit but a bit expensive at 15 a day </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We drove to the hotel which was easy to find 5 minutes off the motorway and the parking on site had plenty of spaces Definitely make use of the tram station station just outside the hotel which brings you straight into to centre with no changes its much cheaper than 20 taxi each way</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Wifi come on its a 5 star hotel and i don t want to pay for watching a movie</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We stayed at Bilderberg Gardens with a couple of friends The hotel is a five star hotel and it really is unless you dare to have a deeper look e g the air condtionsystem started making strange noises from time to time the bar closed every day around 1am Maybe thats critisism on high level but the free wifi was the worst i have ever experienced I am quite sure we are not the target audience for such a hotel but the price was good and the tram station lines 5 and 24 was just a few minute walk away </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> A certain part of the car park as you enter on the right has very low tubes hanging which makes it difficult to park and very limited space The car ariel was restricted by the low tube which meant we parked further into the car park </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very clean and cosy as well as central to everything Staff were welcoming and most importantly the check in was efficient </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The problem was that they took half of the full amount out of my bank account when i specifically chosen to pay at the property To make matters worse now i have to wait a week to get the blocked money back Thats terrible Also on top of that we couldn t even get into unless we pay the full payment plus more money for deposit I have never seen that anywhere not even is hostels On top of that they never clean the room after 1 day By the time we came back and tired the room was not made so no way for them to do it when we wanted to rest Also very poor in complementary items and basic such as water They had 1 small bottle of water and we were 2 people as well as shower gel not generous at all Bad I give them a 4 out of 10 </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The Booking Office was not available to guests as it was taken for an office party The dining room was fully booked until too late for us If you are charging such a lot of money for facilities the guests can rightly expect to be able to use them Not so with us TWICE now morning paper requested did not arrive Bathrobes do not absorb water please try them </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> From the moment we stepped through the doors of the Guesthouse Hotel the staff could not have done more for my boyfriend and I nor been more helpful accommodating and pleasant The rooms were beautifully presented and very well designed with the bathrooms having wonderfully large waterfall showers and gorgeous Molten Brown toiletries As it was our anniversary we were presented with a beautiful hand written welcome card and some cakes upon arrival in our room which was a lovely personal touch An additional highlight was when upon realising I had forgotten my toothbrush I was delighted to be provided with a complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste by the concierge Room service was extremely fast and efficient and the food was just lovely we had breakfast each morning and some cakes for afternoon tea would highly recommend the mini lemon meringue pies The mini bar was extremely well stocked and we were thrilled to find that the majority of the goods were complimentary including bottles of wine and beer amazing value The hotel itself is in an excellent location across from the beautiful Albertina museum and a short walk from the opera houses While the hotel is tucked away on a quiet street there is some great shopping and Christmas markets just around the corner From start to finish we had an absolutely wonderful stay and I honestly could not recommend this hotel enough It is excellent value for money and worth every penny we just wish we could have stayed another night or two Thank you so much Guesthouse Staff Sincerely Young Couple from Dublin Ireland </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We re English we would have liked fresh milk for our tea in the fridge in our room I m sure room service would have brought it in a flash </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The Kaiserhof is well located in a quiet side street about a 10 minute stroll from the centre of town and the Opera House The comfortable building is immaculately maintained with impeccable attention to detail Our room was spacious thoughtfully equipped and competitively priced Breakfast was a delight with lots of delicious Viennoiseries as well as a cooked offer which changed daily and a generous assortment of fruits yoghourts etc But what makes the hotel exceptional is its staff knowledgeable helpful welcoming and genuinely charming they made everything about our stay easy not to mention giving dynamite recommendations for good places to eat We have already recommended this hotel to picky friends and would certainly stay again should we return to Vienna And they have a well priced limo service to the airport </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The team lacked focus on service I asked for an iron and ironing board would have expected these items to be in a room anyway I was told I couldn t have it overnight and would need to call in the morning embarrassing having to open your door wearing PJ s at 7am No tea or coffee making facilities in the room you could purchase tea and coffee if required There was a house being renovated next door constant banging and drilling we wanted to rest for an hour before heading out again that was impossible The room was very small there was a wet patch on the carpet from the radiator general maintenance was poor Would definitely not go back to this hotel it is no where near worth the money we paid I would have been hugely disappointed had I paid the going rate 750 pound for two nights it wasn t worth the 355 we paid Stayed in a holiday inn express for our third night it was by far the most superior of the two at 60 pound for the night Obviously Durrant hotel have an abundance of regular unsuspecting travellers therefore not expecting this feedback to be worth much to them hope it s worth it to the unsuspecting travellers of the future </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The carpets smelled a bit mildewy But that may have been a result either of the doors to a massive balcony or another set of doors leading to a smaller balcony If that s the case it s ok They were also a bit worn and dirty Closets could use an updating as well Everything else was fantastic </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very good location excellent balcony with unbelievable views over Barcelona with the great Sagrada Familia poking out of the landscape Huge comfy bed New beautiful modern bathroom Nice accommodating staff Excellent all around </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was water in the room but it did not have a price so we thought it was no charge as some nice properties offer complimentary water if there is no price I am looking into this to see if this was an error or an accidental charge for something else The barista guy working coffee shop was unfriendly curt and not professional I was taken aback a little by this since the property is so nice and everybody else was so nice He was an angry hipster which has no place in the hospitality industry or a brand like this hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I loved the offering of restaurants lounge and rooftop choices There were little surprises throughout the property The room was well designed and mindful for the guest and I really enjoyed it </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> This is a location you might think of for your sejour in Vienna There is a tram 5 mins of walking that will take you right in the heart of the city at the Wien Opera The rooms are very clean spacious and they got modern furniture The breakfast was really tasty of course could be more various but after all it will do its job the blue cheese was awesome So if you want not to spend to much money on expensive hotels in the centre of town you will definitely want to consider this as a perfect location </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Superb bed Hard to get out of The library bar is a great retreat with the first editions signed by their author s being a great talking point This is a superb location on the edge of the quiet nine streets area which is great for boutique shopping but within easy walking distance to both the museum quarter and the city centre </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There were 2 things that I did not expect to find in a Radisson chain hotel 1 During check in I was surprised to find out that hotel not only needs my credit card information but also wants a security deposit of 140 EUR room was already paid Normally I understand why this is happening but here Why exactly this sum though Minibar contents surely are not worth 140 EUR After checkout they didn t release the blocked amount What if guest needs this money in the end of long journey This is totally unacceptable 2 Floor heating in the bathroom did not work properly As I was trying to switch it on all the electricity in the room was out We could not even close the door because there was an electronic lock It seemed to be a common problem as staff was pretty fast with resolving it Still why to implement floor heating if guests cannot use it </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Pretty standard Radisson hotel room very nice building</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I did mention in my notes that it was my mum s 60th birthday and asked if they could do anything special but we didn t have anything I d noticed other travellers on TripAdvisor had received bottles of fizz and it was sad that they didn t acknowledge my mum s special day There was rather a lot of dust too </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Be warned it you re travelling by public transport there is a 10min walk from the nearest metro or tram stop to the hotel through an industrial zone This is well flagged up on the hotel website but it may present a challenge if you have a lot of luggage and the weather conditions are not ideal The directions to reach the hotel on foot are non trivial so pay careful attention to them The seating round the bar is a bit unusual not very cosy comfortable nor conducive to social mixing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The free WiFi is good e g I was able to watch Netflix Breakfast is not included and costs 20 but there is a fantastic selection of breakfast foods with many different types of freshly baked bread a highlight </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> In May the heating was simply not working We complained but the staff didn t do anything about it In general the staff was not nice or friendly In one of the days they only put towels for one person when me and my friend were both sleeping there The bathroom was clean but the bedroom floor was a bit dirty </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The location was good but next time I will be ok to live further away if I can get a better hotel The central Vienna is very small compared to big cities and walkable </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Rooms are not sound proofed and it gets really loud Despite being on a higher floor we could still hear people talking on the street It also was quite loud when guests above walked through their room wearing heels The cleaning staff did not help getting some rest as they kept slamming doors and furniture throughout the rooms really badly from the beginning of their shift in the morning Despite the racket though they avoided doing the bed properly some days and just tucked in the sheets leaving the filling exposed We would not have minded this so much if we had not suffered from them being so loud </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Friendly staff and spaceous clean rooms Nice lounge terrace Public transportation to city center is nearby We enjoyed a lot having an excellent view from our window to the constantly changing street art exhibit across the street </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Toilet is just toilet It would be nice to have a shelf or something I almost drop by iPhone into it </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> A couple of surprises than typical hotel As I walking in I thought this is not the hotel lobby but a cafe almost going out of the door in searching the right lobby but was greeted by someone confirming this is the lobby Another surprise when I walked in the room the interior of my room was different from most other typical hotel with its unique decor of many special designs A bucket as waste basket too clean to be a trash can a wood box for luggage stool too strong for any travel luggage but at right size a long wood seat or couch next to window with a coffee table too good for an afternoon escape with coffee and a book in hand not to mention two metal stands act as bedside table ps still didn t comprehend how it should be worked Morning breakfast is another comfortable fresh apple carrot banana etc ready for self made morning veggie drink Other typical breakfast item are there scramble egg ham not too many selections but quite plenty Most importantly it is at a very convenient location near Vienna Train station and U Bahn </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I really don t think that you can class this hotel 4 when I arrived there were not towels so I had to ask at the desk for some I came back to the hotel from the city around 23 15 and there was no room service available nor were any of their cafes restaurants open for me to get food On the website it says that both the Savoy Cafe and Bar are open until 24 00 Mon Sunday but neither were open at 23 15 The only way I could get food or drinks was from a vending machine with limited choices There s no way of turning off the lights which are within the bathroom mirror which meant I had a poor night sleep I feel like I am being harsh as the staff were friendly but there is no way this is a 4 hotel and given I paid 150 EUR for 1 night I found it a little disappointing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location of the hotel is great for business trips because you are close to the business parks and also to the metro station that takes you straight into the heart of Amsterdam takes about 15 minutes Staff were also friendly </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We booked a standard double room The room was very small but the bed even smaller It was only 1m35 wide The room was so small that both persons had to get into the bed from the same side The bed was certainly too small for two standard persons When I told the reception the answer was that next time I had to book a superior room The very small bathroom was also very cold The heating in the bathroom was not working while it was freezing outside For all this we payed 249 without breakfast Never again </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> We were surprised at how large or rooms were and how large the buffet breakfast was It was less expensive than we had been paying elsewhere Its proximity to the Underground let us easily find the Vienna Square Dance Club and join them for a dance Wonderful time </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Location the hotel is quite near a few dodgy bars and a massage parlour altho neither sort interfered in any way The room was on the warm side The hotel is an eco hotel so they turn off the heating cooling seemingly without regard to ambient temperature Lifts painfully slow </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> A one off slightly quirky hotel Perfectly comfortable Decent breakfast Location provided you want to be near the Praterstern Reasonable value for money </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Very noisy can hear everything from the other rooms The toilet and bath shower are only enclosed by a glass barrier and the sink is in the room You have to be very comfortable with the person you travel with Carpets are filthy and stained Would not class as 4 star </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Free wifi and good TV channels Hotel bar is decent You can use the other Park Plaza to store luggage by Centraal Station Beautiful location right by Vondelpark in a upper end residential area and 5 mins from tram stop 10 mins walk to the museums </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was very poor and dirty not as I would expect for a 4 star hotel Also one of the managers on duty was extremely rude when I highlighted this issue However this cannot be said for all the staff as everyone else were pleasant and welcoming </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The area although a little far away was beautiful and located near the tram line and park </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Lack of facilities and treatment was not worthy of a hotel that positions itself as luxury I was there in June for my wedding with a big party of guests we took over a lot of rooms in the hotel for a few nights no steamers and no irons are provided They make you use their laundry services which is appalling to oblige guests to do so and charge them when all they want to do is iron a shirt All the guests complained On my wedding day we were getting our hair and makeup done in a few rooms and the electricity kept cutting when the hairdryers were one which delayed everything and created panic Lastly my husband wrote to them a few days before arriving and asked if they could put some flowers in the room to surprise me we were staying in the privilege room and they sent him a cost It was our wedding we should have had welcome flowers in the room to begin with without asking a nice gesture doesn t harm A proper luxury hotel would not do that especially for how expensive they are We were all expecting much more from such a high end hotel Disappointed </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There were the tiniest products in the bathroom so stingy for the price we had to pay and so insufficient for two people for two nights There was a serious lack of staff in the bar after an event and their lack of ability to do their job efficiently was obvious for all to see The cleanliness or lack of it in the corridors was poor there was a piece of plastic bag on our floor when we arrived and it was still there on the second day despite us seeing the cleaners on our floor both days The lack of attention to detail in laying the tables for breakfast no salt and pepper One morning my cup of tea looked like a cup of hot milk when the waitress poured it from a large just of tea</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The breakfast was good and the location of the hotel was perfect for Wembley Arena and Stadium</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> At the end of the rugby match all sorts of people pilled into the bars within the hotel and made this very very difficult just to get back into the hotel front door All the bouncers for the sky bar and sports bar said sorry full capacity cannot let anyone else in even tho the majority of the people in both the bars where not guests Was not happy about this at all you would think paying guests would get first refusal to the bars where they are staying not every Tom Richard and Harry </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Really great location for the rugby match most people where very accommodating Everything you need for a short break </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unhelpful male Manager on the front desk during check in and ignored me when there was a problem with my key card on a separate occasion Poor lazy attitude overall There were Several other problems including being removed from my room and downgraded to a shabby room twice by the same male Manager Rooms smelt damp because you can t open the windows and generally unclean unless you complain To date never been refunded for a forthcoming four night stay from 29 Jan 2016 even though a refund had been requested and submitted to the Director of Operations because of past poor service during several previous stays Never Again I recently checked into a local hotel and guess what Not a single bottle of free alcohol on offer Apparently one local hotel stole the entire shipload in order to keep disgruntled guests happy So I m told </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Rooms were very noisy we could loudly hear the traffic outside our neighbors and when someone was walking upstairs The first family room we had 340 was very run down the next room we got 339 was slightly better but still very dated The shower barely worked in our first room The carpets were dirty The outside of the hotel as well as the reception looks very nice But once inside the corridors and the rooms everything is very run downed and dated This hotel is in dire need of a complete makeover I guess this is a very typical Victorian London Hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The hotel is currently being refurbished and they have only two very small and highly unreliable lifts out of the original four running You wait a very long time but with lots of luggage the stairs are not an option The room was very bijou small A single shot of brandy at the bar cost 14 PLUS a service charge of 2 25 for pouring it ouch The doorman was never there when we were moving in and out with luggage etc Lancaster Gate Tube station is immediately adjacent but closed for renovations and refurbishment currently There s a moderate amount of building noise to contend with during the days but it was not too intrusive in our area of the hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is excellent within easy walking distance of Paddington Hyde Park the main shops of Oxford Street and within very comfortable walking distance of all the Kensington museums and facilities For the location facilities and cleanliness the room price was very reasonable presumably as compensation for the renovation works The receptions staff were all lovely and very friendly The general ambiance of the hotel was pleasant subdued elegant and understated rather than brash and loud The room was clean and the bathroom spotless with lovely fresh towels and pleasant toiletries </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The beds were not all that comfortable but not all that surprising considering that seems to be the norm in Europe The size of the room its amenities and services makes up for any deficiencies of the bed </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel is located near many attractions on the edge but a short walk or transit The staff were wonderful and helpful they helped book a tour for me helped with directions and even played nurse doctor when I cut myself The rooms were large and spacious The wine selection in your room is wonderful or you can try from their menu on the terrace courtyard The overhead shower was magnificent </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Linen was damaged there was a hole on a sheet I was surprised that during regular cleaning nobody changed it We didn t have possibility to eat in restaurant because it was busy by groups Even if you want to order soft drink you have to search staff by yourself and ask about attention to you We ordered pizza in room service it was not cut on pieces and staff didn t put even cutlery to do it by ourself Those issues are not so critical but annoying Pizza was good by the way </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The service is terrible They first said they would change the bedding in my tiny single room Then later 10 30pm said that they were unable to provide non feather pillows and when asked are rude about it and I quote We are a hotel we do not cater for allergies I contacted the hotel before writing this review and gave them 10 days to respond and they haven t So I don t think customer service is anything they really care about If you have an allergy stay away </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The quality of the internet access is awful In 2016 it is not acceptable to have so low speed Even if the access is for free it cannot be used I suggest that you charge EVERY room per night a few Euros more and spend this money to provide better speed for the access </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Great staff Very convenient to city center from the hotel We also took the tram to the train station which took us right into the airport Would definetly stay at the hotel again </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I liked everything about this hotel so the only set back is the price we got a huge discount but with the regular price we would probably never decided to stay there and we would never know how great this hotel is </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> This hotel is great located in an interesting area of up and coming district of former ship yard You have to take a free ferry to the Central station but it only takes 10 minutes and actually is an atraction itself The room was really nice with great view of the city The staff at the reception was great very helpful especially Melissa went out of her way to make us feel at home At the best part they keep warm chocolate cookies at the reception and You can help yourself whenever You want </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room was very noisy with a large gap betweem the entrance door and the floor so you could hear all the noises from the hallway We barely slept Also the shower was wery hard to use and we had to leave the water running for 10 minutes before it was hot The hotel has 4 stars but it should be rated at 3 Very basic room with highly overpriced minibar We will not return here </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is very good near Estacion de Sants </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> View was of dingy roof tops drapes and the sheer curtains closed for privacy which made the room less bright during the day </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very convenient in the city center and close to everything There are many very good restaurants within 30 seconds to 30 minute walking times We enjoyed the breakfast buffet fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent A variety of cold meats as well as cooked the wonderful flakey buttery croissants and fresh fruits and coffee machine NICE Staff was very helpful and friendly They made nearby restaurant recommendations which we enjoyed Tour arrangements can be made easily at the front desk Nice warm fire in the bar lounge on cold nights </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Location was great 25min walk from the train station meaning that we explored the real Amsterdam instead of sticking to the main tourist areas Hotel staff were perfect so helpful and kind My Fianc turned 30 during our stay they helpfully arranged a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival and also were kind enough to gift us with sweets biscuits and complementary drinks at the bar on his actual birthday We ve had a lovely few days thank you </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Very bad guest service The front office staff don t smile at you They always stare Only two people in front office gave a warm and pleasant response when we approached them The staff for breakfast don t have time to receive and seat you You have to find a clean table to be seated or you have to pick a table and tell them to clean Poor staffing for breakfast The hotel cooling system is not set on during April even though the outside temperature is 20 C plus so the room will be more hotter if you turn it on You will be dependent on opening the windows for fresh and cool air which is unsafe and traffic noise at night Toilets aren t clean </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Good variety of breakfast Sants estancio L3 metro just outside the door And Barcelona sants railway station is few minutes away from the hotel Great location for public transportation especially metro </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I can t fault anything at all helpful staff great room The only thing was the hair dryer when I turned it on it sounded like it was going to explode I switched it off immediately and it had a burning smell and what felt like a little shock to my finger I informed reception and they were very apologetic </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The room was great very comfy bed and lots of nice touches The bathroom was lovely especially the shower I contacted the hotel to ask if at all possible we could have an upper floor room as me and my partner were celebrating her birthday and our anniversary I am happy to say they delivered and we had a view as well so was delighted </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> At check in we got a bit of fuss for booking with booking com I am a Hilton Honors member Gold level My spouse was attending an academic conference so when he had to book it made the most sense for his needs When I decided to go along I did not go expecting to collect a bunch of points or anything but being recognized as a loyal customer would have been nice and not calling so much attention to fact we were really missing out on a lot of points as a result of not using hilton com </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> When we asked staff something 9 out of 10 went out of their way to answer or assist We asked for a lot of help when we arrived and they really were nice about it I normally check in and never ask for much We had connectivity issues with the wifi and it was a wild goose chase but they persisted and came back when things still were not resolved They were all helpful and cheerful and I was quite flustered trying to get online to attend a meeting with my office We asked for some advice on restaurants or asked them to make a reservation for one we wanted to try They were very helpful The food and beverage we had were very good Also we had access to the Executive Lounge This was a great option for us because we stayed for 9 nights We could have a nice place to sit and relax and at other times enjoy refreshments The hotel location was optimal we arrived at Centraal Station and easily made the walk over to the hotel with our luggage The Sky Lounge has a gorgeous view it is worth going up for a look it does get quite crowded up there Enjoyed food and drink and looking out the window there </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Expensive but I guess due to location it was ok but the price did not include breakfast which would have made the room price overly expensive There are better priced central places to stay but for a cruise this was a better choice pricewise than the Movenpick </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> We chose this hotel due to the closeness to the terminal for a cruise It was an easy 10 minute walk with the suitcases to board our cruise ship Also we had rented a car from Sixt and their office is right beside the hotel lobby so made it easy to collect and drop off car </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We didn t try the breakfast buffet as at all but 6 Euros we considered it too expensive Apart from that just a couple of gripes our room was on the cold side a matter which would no doubt have been remedied if we had complained and the complimentary toiletries shampoo conditioner and body lotion were impossible to use The holes in the top of the containers were too small and one couldn t squeeze out the contents because the containers were too rigid I suggest the management tries for themselves </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were absolutely first class from the moment we arrived to the moment we left Our room was well appointed and the bed exceedingly comfortable We had a nice meal in the restaurant where my partner ordered off menu with no trouble at all </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The pictures of the room we booked did not correspond to the real one we had The staff on the reception did not want to do anything about it giving strange explanation that the room we booked was even smaller then the one we got which of course was not true </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel is quite close to the beach and beautiful Ciutadella park is 10 min walk Housekeeping did a good job </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> When we arrive there the woman at the reception said that our booking was cancelled and she did not trying to help us at all We had to wait quite a long time to get our room which was very annoying after a long travelling to found the hotel The last day we checked out and left our luggage to the hotel later on we found out that our flight was cancelled We wanted to book one more night but they tried to charge us double In the end I went to the booking com website and we booked through booking com while they were waiting in the reception It was ridiculous </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The fact that breakfast service stops at 11 am is a bid old fashioned given the lifestyles and behaviors of the clientele Although they might be older by passport they stay up long sleep in and then would like to have a proper breakfast even when its 1pm The person preparing the Starbucks coffee had no idea milk overheated although great coffee bad preparation </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Reception staff On arrival I was effectively ordered to wait whilst the surly staff member did something terribly important on his computer for fully five minutes Finally I was checked in by a second employee who had been chatting the whole time with another person However I m STILL waiting to be welcomed to the hotel During my five day stay only one staff member offered friendly greetings as I came and went It seems most of the others especially Mr Surly don t know the value of a customer Sound proofing in rooms is excellent in blocking out street noise but between rooms adjacent and above footfalls cupboard doors and water noises were disturbing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location was perfect of course The room was well spacious and well appointed housekeeping staff were excellent and the rooftop bar was extremely pleasant We enjoyed a beautiful pizza with drinks and found the staff up there to be quite delightful full of smiles and very friendly The hotel has modern attractive decor and is pleasantly light </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Even though it s right by the beach it s a bit far from Barcelonata the main beach area and from the other main attractions at the centre A bit far from both the train bus stops 12 min away Internet was ok could be a bit faster Restaurants close by are a bit overpriced</Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Pool is really nice with a good view of the beach We asked for a an upper level room with Seaview and the very nice receptionist accommodated our request Breakfast was worth every penny Room size is decent and comfortable Availability of E bikes that you can rent Can take pool towels to the beach</Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Would loved to have had a tea coffee tray with kettle in room rather than a minibar but room service was prompt and not too expensive However just read another review about free tea and coffee in the hall which I was not aware of a note in the Room Service Menu to mention this would have been useful </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Right beside Barcelona Sants station so perfect for an overnight stay between trains and will use again Good sized room for a double with large comfy bed </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The pool is very small and maybe I expected an indoor pool and spa for this rate </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great location very close to two of Gaudi s best creations The hotel itself was very plush and staff very curteous There was a mistake with our room and we were taken to a much more luxurious suite they then transferred us to our room when they realised this wasn t a big deal for me but the hotel staff gave us a tasty fruit plate and an apology note for this mishap Very generous Really appreciated the concierge advice on vegan restaurants and also for good spots to go to at night overall very very satisfied </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> It is hard to find friendlier and more helpful hotel staff anywhere in the world Fantastic and attentive service throughout the hotel The Radio Bar really comes to life in the evening with great sunset views over the city and a chic crowd And of course very helpful bar staff Very comfortable room with every detail attended to </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had the breakfast and dinner option The breakfast was alright with most of the usual options The evening meal was very plain It is advisable to get in early as all dishes are not kept supplied and you may find options limited Very limited variety of sweet in fact there are more types of sweet offered at breakfast You also have to pay for drinks Though we had already paid we opted to eat out mostly There is a coffee shop bar on the ground floor but it does not have anything to eat Bathroom had a shower which could be hand held or overhead Never did work out how to change from one to other Overall a very disappointing stay and would never stay at a Glam Hotel again </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> It was very close to Milan Central Station An easy walk away But the area around the station feels quite unsafe Cleaning staff were excellent One of the cleaners speaks better English than any of the counter staff She would be much more useful on the front desk </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We stayed too short to enjoy the chic bar in the ground floor We will keep it for next time </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Amazing new hotel at best possible location Stylish trendy comfortable and very cozy Even though windows overlook Central Station square the room is very quiet and you can fully relax and enjoy the designed bathroom and pleasant interior of the room The breakfast had a variety of choices and was very tasty Italian ham cheese but also standard but quality continental choice We definitely enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting Milan as one of the best values for money you can get </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room we were given didn t over look the square but a side street we were disappointed with that The bar area could have been staffed better On our departing morning we arrived at breakfast at the opening time We had little time for breakfast and had to go without due to nothing being ready and having a train to catch </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The room was a good size The hotel is really close to the central railway station its easy to get to the tourist attractions the hop on tourist bus has a stop just outside the hotel The buffet dinner was a surprise the selection of food was good and it was fresh and hot We did get in early and I could perhaps see things running out towards the end of service </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I was charged to my credit card the whole amount of the booking including extras during the night aldo i informed the receptionist my desire to pay by by cash At the time of check out i payed again for the whole amount by cash and after 3 days the amount debited by the hotel hasnt been unblocked as a result it looks like i have payed the hotel two times mr bruno from the reception wasnt able to reassure me and now i had to call the hotel to ask them to refund ASAP the whole amount charged to my card as pre authorization i was told by mr Davide by phone that it might take 3 to 10 days for the hotel to unblock the amount from my card im unhappy about this issue since mr bruno didnt even gave me a copy of the pre authorization costumers should be informed and during the booking here in bookings com the offer said that no amount was going to be charged to my credit card but it isnt true</Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Perhaps the entrance to the hotel did not reflect it s status When we arrived we had to walk through the afternoon tea area and were a little bewildered as to where the reception was However a member of staff immediately stepped in and helped us with our luggage and showed us the correct reception desk </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> From the moment we arrived we were treated most politely and helpfully The room was very comfortable especially the bed superb </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> It s a little out of the way from central Amsterdam but the free shuttle is well worth it and it is only a short walk into the centre Shower bath can be a little dangerous and is quite small and the bathroom doors are just vanity covers so the bathroom can t be fully closed off </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Bed was amazing Very comfy pillows and plenty of room Didn t crowd the room as well which was nice Buffet breakfast is to a high standard and staff are welcoming and friendly at all times Room service is good value and very quick </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The beds are firm but very comfortable The location is excellent with Las Ramblas and El Raval on the door step and El Bourn and the Harbour only 10 mins walk away The location lends itself to being noisy at night and yes the walls a thin but ear plugs and the black out blinds will have you sleeping like a teenager </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Though very convenient for the work conference it wasn t at all convenient for the rest of what we wanted to see in BCN That definitely makes it a tradeoff We picked it partly b c of the rooftop pool thinking that my mom and son could relax and play there while I was at work mtg but the pool was a scene really only for women not fun for a grandmother and teenager The hotel had a lot of generic ads about things to do in BCN they could give more specific info about the beach and how to get to it it took me 4 days to realize where to go to get to the beach The first 3 times I walked out of the conference center I only saw the cement area behind the CCIB and thought that s all there was nearby but it wasn t They also could have made a more specific rec about the Museu Blau which was right across the street and was FABULOUS </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Clean pleasant common area in the back was as pleasant as could be with construction going on was right across from the CCIB where my work conference was happening so very convenient for the work part of my trip nice workout room Fabulous spread at breakfast not clear which breakfast days breakfast was included with room or not </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Bit disappointed in a couple of very small things First wi fi was not entirely free Secondly it may have been a mistake but the teabags were not replenished once we had just two cups of tea the first morning Now as I said it might have been a mistake on the part of those who cleaned the room but I paid 816 for the two night stay so on both counts we feel that this was a bit churlish on the part of the W hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> View from room really disappointing considering we had paid for a more expensive wonderful room View of harbour sea obscured by the building and was not great Possibly unfortunate as I am sure other rooms offered better views Pools also very small for the size of the hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Staff very accommodating and outstanding service Interior of room excellent Breakfast had a wide choice of options and of an excellent standard Overall a lovely hotel and a great base for a weekend in Barcelona </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The opaque glass walls of the bathroom meant that using the facilities in the night slightly disturbed the other person with the light but it certainly didn t detract from a perfect stay </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The bed was very comfortable Very clean Lovely fully furnished balcony overlooking courtyards at the back of the hotel Powerful hot shower Great touch having a glass of cava on arrival and as it was my husband s 40th birthday we were treated to complimentary cava and chocolates Thank you for helping to make our time in Barca great </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We paid for a room with a view in reality it overlooked a rather ugly courtyard There were a few issues in our room that had to be fixed on request late housekeeping came on request broken bed fixed broken lamp on balcony that was not fixed For some reason housekeeping came really late around 4pm every day The sink is next to the bed instead of inside the bathroom which is a little strange </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very convenient location for exploring Barcelona airport bus drops off 5 mins walk away Breakfast was good Free sweets in lobby The reception staff were friendly Good wifi </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The room next door to me was being renovated which meant I woke up to builders on my balcony one morning The reception were great and got them to stop right away There was also drilling next door on my last day I understand hotels have to keep up with maintenance but it was a little disappointing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The view was amazing the bed massive and comfy The shower was like being in a monsoon in a good way The indoor pool was lovely and warm and everywhere was clean and well looked after </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Upstairs Pillar in the middle of our room shower could only be accessed through the toilet and was all glazed some decoration looked tired and dated The breakfast food area could be a bit crowded There was too much self service for the price and tables were not cleared in a timely way </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very central could get from aeroport bus to hotel across Placa very easily or indeed for cheaper with a taxi if you are a group of four negotiate Comfortable good sized bed good views from top floor over Barri Gothic and Placa de Catalunya but could not see the Familia Sagrada from our room as indicated by the website very helpful reception staff who were always cheerful and booked us a restaurant we had chosen Door men always greeted us with a smile </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The pool is far too small for the number of guests had to wait for courtesy towel and also hard to get a sun lounger as they were all occupied very early morning There was a constant stream of guests checking in out meaning there was a long wait at reception if we had any queries The television in the room has very little on offer </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Location was perfect so close to the metro station and the Magic Fountain is 5 minute walk from the hotel Beds were very comfortable </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Be careful enough what side of the hotel your room is on Get on the smaller canal side not the side of the main road it is noisy to say nothing of the construction going on right outside the hotel We had to move rooms after one night it was so bad the girl who checked us in made a mistake and put us on the wrong side Breakfast was good but service not good You order eggs if you are not treated as though you are invisible and then they forget to get them from the kitchen When you repeatedly chase up they finally come cold and rubbery as they had been waiting to be delivered for so long This happened two days in a row so on the third day we went into the kitchen ourselves to monitor and get the eggs when cooked All was good after that </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> What a fascinating hotel Amazing historic architecture and d cor This is truly a unique property that needs to be experienced It even has an old paternoster lift only works for demonstrations though The location is excellent particularly if you come by train as it is very close to Amsterdam Central Station The room while old was comfortable and quiet you can even open a window Wi Fi was good The room service salads were excellent too </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> We were upgraded to a canal view room The room size and bathroom is nice The shower is large and the hairdryer was one of the best I have had in a hotel in awhile The location is super close to the train station and very central for exploring the city </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Poor value for money Bath is old fashioned the shower was leaking all the time out of the bath tub I fixed it myself but kept leaking Booked a comfort double room and asked for a room with a good view a month in advance I was told I should have paid more to guarantee a canal view one so I decided to not going fo it but ended up in a small double with an awful view something like and internal courtyard I paid around 400 euro for two nights and unfortunately they were not worth it for having a room like that Only 2 small shower towels are provided and 2 face ones if I haven t visited other hotels of the same range price in other countries this last month I would have probably rated the hotel better but i think it s too expensive for what it has been offered Friendly staff at least </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was a water leak in the bathroom above us and we had to move room We were very tactfully moved to the Junior Suite room 308 which was lovely as it over looks the canal and it s a beautiful room but there are steps to go up to the room so with lots of luggage it might be a problem for some However if it wasn t for this there would be nothing to complain about </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great location with easy tram just outside the door extremely helpful and polite staff and very comfortable and spacious room Definitely recommend </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> This was the neatest hotel I ve ever stayed in So modern and absolutely perfect for a layover for a couple or if you just plan to sleep there which is what most travelers to a new city should do The beds are humongous the electronically controlled mood setting for the room and the black out curtain are exactly what a weary jet lagged traveler needs and this hotel caters to individual or couples perfectly </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I didn t love that the toilet was enclosed by a semi opaque capsule </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The wall to wall bed was amazing The room was run by an iPad mini and had so many fun options Black out shades for sleeping were fantastic and we didn t hear any street or hotel noises It was so easy to check ourselves in on one of the kiosks and activate our own room keys </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Bathroom and toilet are in the room located in two giant glass test tubes Have a look on line and you will see takes a little getting used to so maybe not ideal for your first ever romantic break as a couple No fridge but the 24hr bar will give you ice as well as sell you beverages </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Great staff who care about hospitality Biggest bed ever Cool climate lighting media controls Very clean Located a little out of centre in the WTC Rai area but buy a travelcard and get the number 5 tram to the action Quick easy access by train tram or taxi to airport Good value Nice lounge and bar area Will stay again for sure The late checkout until 4pm option was perfect and a sensible price </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The windows cannot be opened which is absurd as the environment is so quiet and green The room architecture includes a WC without any possibility of washing oneself One has to take a shower every time one needs to go as the shower does not function unless the doors of the cabin are closed The architect should have learned a little and consider the ergonomic science </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is excellent close to the train as well as public transportation The neighborhood is quiet and green near a beautiful park Very interesting inside architecture </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only thing I wasn t too happy about was that there were no atms anywhere The nearest atm was one stop away on the train The train is also a 12 minute walk away from the hotel which was a hassle of you needed cash </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The view from our balcony was lovely The room was very pretty and spacious where I slept like a baby in that super comfy bed The facilities were good and the staff were always helpful and friendly It was a really good stay </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The only downside was the room It was absolutely freezing in the bathroom and we only got the room cleaned once the whole time we were there so nothing was really cleaned or changed when they did come in they made the bed but didn t actually clean or tidy anything including cups we had for cups of tea Also they were coming to clean at 3 4 o clock when we d been out all day </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Absolute ideal location right in the square with everything in walking distance Rooms good size hotel lobby lovely and staff were friendly </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> When arriving they did not have a room I requested with a king size bed but instead only a twin room They offered to push the beds together but that is not the point Pillows are extremely thin and soft so you literally need 3 pillows to be even remotely comfortable Breakfast is sub standard for a 4 star hotel with only 3 kinds of cereal and un edible eggs There we no toillettries in the bathroom and you had to call to have those brought to you Tea coffee facilities are not standard in the room and must be paid for additionally Rooms facing Renweg street are very noisy and you can t sleep with a window open which is why I requested a quiet room but when I arrived there were none available </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Hotel is within walking distance of main tourist sights although it is a 20 minute walk </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Given the central location near a busy road there can be noise The hotel is also illuminated at night until 9 or 10pm and the light might come into your room however there are good shutters and dark curtains that help </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Many breakfast choices with table service for coffee Caught a sunny day and was sitting outside with a view on the park nothing too spectacular but much better than sitting indoors Friendly staff and central location only some 2 minutes from a U Bahn U2 line subway stop which made arrival via Wien Hauptbahnhof Vienna Central Station easy From the hotel it is also only minutes to walk into the 1 Bezirk First District downtown to enjoy coffee and Sachertorte at Hotel Cafe Sacher Cafe Demel or other Kaffeehaeuser coffee shops and to visit museums or just stroll through the streets Around the corner is the Charly P s Irish Pub which has fantastic food with several awards The fish chips are stunning </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We had a bag stolen from the small restaurant at breakfast on our first morning It was captured on CCTV and the perpetrators entered through the main door of the hotel past reception and past the restaurant staff Despite our foolishness in our view the security needs to be improved All the staff were kind empathic and helpful but it would have been good if they had contacted the police directly as we lost a whole day of a very short break reporting the theft making statements etc We had half board and felt the 2 choices of main course was too limiting A milk jug for our breakfast tea would have been a nice addition but that s just plain pernickety </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> A substantial breakfast with good choices Comfortable beds clean rooms good service The restaurant staff were all amazing pleasant kind helpful The food was generally very good with a good choice of wines Would definitely stay again and recommend </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> A reasonable room rate that included breakfast would be good We did not eat in the restaurant it look great as it was over priced and there are tons of cafes and alternatives around </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location just near the cathedral and metro was excellent A good base in central Vienna to do anything from We had a top floor room that had a good view of the cathedral so it was quite magical The bed was extra comfy too When we arrived the staff member that checked us in was efficient offering us a drink and was interested in what our plans were so as to offer help in organising our Vienna visit We didn t need any but it was good that he asked </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was obviously work going on in the building which was extremely annoying Loud drilling from about 9 10am till about 3 5pm Annoying when you just want to have a lay in but it won t be there all the time The breakfast however was poor And this is such a noticeable point because this isn t the first time I ve stayed at a Crowne Plaza hotel but this was mostly dry overcooked items of an English Breakfast It was that bad Sausages and Bacon was okay though Everything else was awful Quality must improve here </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The bed was comfortable as usual with a Crowne Plaza hotel The television was quality and a good size however I would have valued some smart TV capabilities The sofa in the room was a nice touch Facilities were clean and easy to use and this was especially apparent in the Bathroom Very very nice </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The tea and coffee were not refilled in time for check in We upgraded our room on arrival however had to request the mini bar to be filled at 5 30pm after checking in at 9 30am It then took an hour to arrive Very disappointing </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I would like to praise the concierge staff that day 2nd and 3rd July 2016 he was amazing It was a male member of staff with big hair very vibrant welcoming and gave us some fabulous tourist information A credit to your team and a pleasure to talk to </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> A very disturbed nights sleep Neither my partner or I could sleep due to a particular noise every 5 to 10 minutes It can only be described as someone hoovering or maybe some type of fan </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The beds don t look like hotel beds and feels like a hostel with plain white sheets and tiny covers Pillows were terrible and extremely soft You have to fold them multiple times Location is so far from the city public transport would take 1 hr whereas taxi takes 15 minutes So prepare to spend alot on taxis if you re short on time </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The architecture is beautiful Surrounding scenery and nature is stunning Bathroom is modern and nice The hotel restaurant was really good and breakfasts were consistently good each day and had a lot of variety </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately our trip was made very stressful as the rooms booked were not available We were a wedding party wanting rooms on the same floor and in various party sizes We were allocated all over the hotel and the wrong type of rooms We paid extra for accommodation we did not get and the staff seemed unconcerned The bride to be was further away from everyone making it very difficult to help her get ready and she had a very small room My son s room had a cracked toilet which he reported but nothing was done about There was lots of little things wrong which may not have seemed as bad had there been less problems with the arrangements booked </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The fact that this hotel is rated 5 is one of the biggest hoaxes I have seen in the last ten years NOTHING about this place is not even remotely 5 1 The rooms look shabby furniture and wooden paneling are old scratched faulty or broken 2 Bathroom is about as bland as a motel bathroom 3 Breakfast are looks like a cantine food is of low quality at the opposite of what one would expect of a touted 5 4 Slippers were NOT provided we had to ask three different people in order to provide a pair 5 Wireless is slow and signal is poor Save yourselves a lot of energy and avoid this place unless you want a motel like accomodation sold as five star </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> We booked a double bed room but we got a twin bed room pushed together We had a problem with the bathtub because it was clogged we asked them to fix it and their fix was to remove the drain cover We asked to change the room they offered first a room with twin bed this time separate which was not acceptable so they offered us an upgraded room which we found out was not an actual upgrade as it didn t have a bathtub and it had a shower with the same problem seems like the hotel has a problem with plumbing and it was noisy too so we had to decline that offer as well and ask them to fix the problem with our room which they promised they would do but they didn t until we left One more thing the breakfast was very limited in choices </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The staff here are so friendly always have smiles on their faces too The food is delicious Salad on the burgers were very fresh succulent burgers fresh chips nothing I could complain about regarding service or food The cleanliness of the whole hotel was immaculate by far the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in Perfect weekend away </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> There was air con and the room temperature was 30C But the worst was that they didn t do anything to help me They didn t even offer me to change room so that I could have a window or something to make the situation better I should have WiFi but I forgot to ask about and nobody reminded me of it while in all other hotels I have stayed up to now they all inform you about things like that </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Staff especially Sebastiaan and Rianne were very friendly and helpful It was our anniversary and we got a room with a view and the bed was decorated with a heart towel and balloons Nice touch Great location Tram stop 2 second walk from hotel the no13 takes you right into centre in 5 10 mins Shuttle bus picks you up at airport and takes back to hotel for free and only 5 each to get back to hotel so saves you getting trains or trams and saves you money too Hotel bar was nice a little expensive but Amsterdam is expensive no matter where you go </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Absolutely perfect If one were to complain that it could be closer it would negate the reality that closer hotels are more expensive with often less features and smaller rooms </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Absolutely best fit in all categories Location free cheap shuttle to Schipol On a direct metro stop to Centraal Modern Clean Full Featured rooms and facility with all bells and whistles Professional Friendly staff who bend over backward to make your stay not only comfortable but special Rooftop bar Restaurant with food available at all hours with great view and ambiance Value is phenomenal when you compare it to typical AMS hotels perfect balance of features price and location</Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> It was my 3rd stay in Amsterdam and this is by far the best The King executive room was exactly as expected very spacious clean and bright The bed and pillows were the comfiest of them all Also the view was very pleasant to wake up to as I was on the 9th floor I had a clear view of the city The 17th floor roof top area is such a beautiful relaxing open space with an incredible view equipped with a bar a comfy chill out area sunbeds and also lovely chairs sofas and tables to eat Staff were so welcoming and polite that I questioned whether anyone ever had a bad day They were very helpful and informative on what to do in Amsterdam and where the best spots were and even gave us a toothbrush and 2 adaptors to borrow when asked for no extra cost It s about 15 20 mins from Amsterdam central on tram and the tram stop is about a 3 minute walk so overall I would recommend this hotel for all types of stay because I will be returning with no doubt </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Hotel was very clean staff were really helpful in organizing our airport pickup while we were out for the night they left a note for us in the room to save us waiting around the little things Location was great just a few minutes walk to all major attractions</Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> I ve stayed at the Savoy several times and the service is consistent The staff is very friendly and goes out their way to accommodate any needs one may have They are very willing to go above and beyond and do not rest on their laurels I am always impressed with the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff and hotel every person on the staff takes ownership of any need the guests may have I have stayed at The Shangri La and the Corinthia in London and the Savoy continues to outshine them with the friendliness and attentiveness </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The very first pic for this hotel on Booking com shows a big elegant looking building which we thought to be the hotel when in fact it is the building across the street Kind of misleading as we thought we were paying to stay in that nice building The hotel is in sort of an apartment block and ou have to take the elevator up to the 3rd floor for reception Also they won t give to the controller to the air conditioner unless you request it even then I was told we didn t need it as it gets cool in the evenings and we could leave our windows open I said it was too noisy with traffic and sirens but they replied that no it wasn t and it was quite quiet I felt like they were playing the Jedi mind trick on me these aren t the droids you re looking for </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> I found Jaro at the front desk very helpful and genuine He made the stay enjoyable for me The common areas were clean and nicely decorated The location was about a 5 minute walk to some nice restaurants which was good Breakfast was good with good coffee </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The hotel was centrally located in downtown Vienna Easy walking distance to many of the sights and the U Bahn stations There is construction going on across the street from the hotel resulting in increased noise levels in the hotel room during working hours 0900 1800 However the hotel recognized this inconvenience and provided earplugs in the room as well as 50 off at the hotel bar </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The hotel overcharged us by quietly changing the room rates we had booked via Booking com We knew about the additional city tax of course but they had entered the wrong rates on the system Unfortunately we only noticed after the payment had gone through at which point the receptionist who admitted the mistake told us that refunds could only be processed centrally but someone would be in touch the next day I have since then emailed the hotel twice to request a refund but have not even received a reply They also tried to charge us for the minibar which was included in the room rate we did spot that one in time so I do wonder whether accidental overcharging might in fact be the norm here I find this a completely unacceptable level of customer service from a 4 hotel and will never book with this chain again </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The location is excellent a short stroll from the Duomo and from the restaurants in Brera The trains to and from Malpensa depart from Cadorna station which is just five minutes away on foot and there is a metro station right outside the hotel The room was clean and spacious if rather lacking in ambiance and came with complimentary soft drinks The breakfast buffet had plenty of choice </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Location this would be our preferred hotel in Milan Being in a corner and facing the car park of the Milan central station the open view is amazing Top floor has a terrace and perfect for early evening time off after a hectic day out The lobby is perfect for small business meetings which saves us meeting room rental The bar serves an amazing Aperitif </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The receptionist was not friendly and welcoming We had to park our car in their parking it is very difficult to find we received just a few explanations you have to have someone from the hotel open you the parking door and you have to leave your keys at the reception It was not convinient at all when you have luggages Plus it cost 29 EUR just for one night this is really a scam The location is close to a business area which makes the place completely dead during the week end with several bums on the streets No decent restaurant in the neighbourhood </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Spacious bedroom for 4 people we really enjoyed having 2 large beds and still lots of room left The breakfast was great lots of choice good fresh fruits The room was very clean as well as the bathroom and the rest of the hotel </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> 1 How good they are cleaning room I knew by finding someone s sneakers under my bed no comments 2 The second day after a long trip I wanted to have some drinks and snacks in my room from the bar but the bar wasn t working in working hours The woman at the reception told me by phone that I can go to a pizza next to hotel to order a takeaway and then eat it in the room This is 4 stars hotel I think that it wasn t so hard to offer me a help with ordering to my room 3 You don t have a bathrobe in you room and no slippers but from the papers in the room you can find that you can ask them for bathrobes No information about slippers but if you will ask both they will help you You need to ask for such things in 4 stars </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> One of the worst hotel I have ever seen No cattle iron hairdryer is not working I requesting some ice to make Compresses to my child they answered no we don t have I requested a cattle to prepare some tea they answered rudely not available The breakfast is so poor bread and cakes The location is out of nowhere in the middle of industrial zone far from the center with 30 minutes with the car The staff need a lot of training how to deal with the guests they seems to be not caring if you are satisfied or not The room is full of mosquitos and flies Parking costs you 8 euro per night and you have to check the kiosk every time you come out the parking I strongly not recommending this hotel for any one </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> The drive from the train station to our accommodation was not far would have been a good hour s drive if we had travelled from the airport Nice smallish hotel in a reasonable location We walked to the Milan cathedral from our hotel and it didn t take that long approximately 30 minutes Staff at the hotel helped with directions which was very much appreciated The hotel didn t have a restaurant so we dined out couple of recommendations from staff again Ate in an absolutely fabulous gourmet pizza place 5 minutes walk from our accommodation The best and I mean very best pizza we have ever eaten We have eaten pizza all over the world and definitely couldn t beat this one Room clean not big but after a bit of rearranging we could accommodate our 2 suitcases and move around still Breakfast reasonable but there is a charge of 10 00 euro s per person The hotel staff helped us with route decisions when we doing the Hop On Off bus this saved us a lot of time If you are in Milan and a bit of a foodie you should go to Peck an up market food place which is a bit like your Harrod s David Jones food courts Not far from the cathedral about a 5 minute walk All in all our short stay in Milan was lovely </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Most receptionists have really bad attitudes Free wifi only 500mb a day Its sad booking com advertise them like this not all facilities listed by booking com is provided Photos are different from actual room Breakfast is just edible Superb breakfast review are fake or it is from people having their first croissant Rather have breakfast outside with the price It is a good room just feel cheated as advertises Not worth the money 2 star treatment for 4 star price 3 star accommodation go only if you are desperate </Negative_Review>

		<Positive_Review> Very good choice considering that Milan is primarily an urban setting for tourists The hotel is primarily a business hotel but still made it very easy for tourists The staff were friendly and courteous and provided great guidance around the city The breakfast was great too The hotel is a few steps away from metro station as well as places to eat </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> I had a half board reservation and breakfast and dinner was included While checking out receptionist lady made me pay extra 6 Euros for the breakfast and she said it is a mistake but she couldn t undo it As I had to rush for my flight I could t care less and I paid for it Another thing is that their lightning in the room is too dim and it is not good for business travelers who wants to work in the room in the evening like me </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Our reservation was half board and I enjoyed the dinner so much It was very delicious and they had very good quality menu I highly recommend staying half board in this hotel Also I want to thank Marco who served our dinner in a very kindly manner and he was so kind to treat us with cappucinos </Positive_Review>

		<Positive_Review> If you are travelling to Milan this is the place to stay A comfortable and affordable 4 star hotel just a one minute walk to the subway and a 10 minute walk to one of the main shopping districts Marghera They are dog friendly and they provide parking so you can leave your car and visit Milan on foot The immediate area offers small shops and street food Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful a full buffet with flaky croissants excellent selection of coldcuts and cheese and scrambled eggs and bacon Very highly recommend the Antares Rubens for anyone visiting Milan </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Staff staff staff Room size V Bad smell all over No parking Their are so many hotels around this gray one and much nicer I have no idea how they got 5 stars None of the 5 stars criteria met No gym no business center no lobby no view no swimming pool breakfast very poor and very bad staff with rude attitude Just an advise to any travelers if you plan visit Milano DONT take a nonrefoundble room believe me it s worth it to pay more but you will have the chance to chose and those ppl in this ugly gray hotel knew that you have no way out because of our selection of nonrefoundble room I will never ever go back and I don t recommend it to any body Again as an advisor of trip adviser site look for so many hotels around the doumo and make sure you book a none gray hotel look for white hotels </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately we had a bad experience with restaurant staff that evening who were arguing with each other Also kitchen staff chef coming looking in on restaurant and staring at us several times Restaurant very cold and poor choices Very uncomfortable situation however after feedback with Gabriel restaurant Supvr he apologised and put into place some service recovery by offering us drinks in bar and left word with reception staff next morning to apologise again They offered small gift as part of apology Shame about all this as hotel very comfortable but they need to review staff performance and somehow give restaurant a lift to encourage more people to use Perhaps not in a convenient floor for guests to use Hope this feedback helps Manager to improve facilities and address staff issues </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The breakfast was extremely unappetizing There were carrots string beans and peanuts in the shell As far I m concerned those are not breakfast items </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> It was very clean However we did have to upgrade because what was described as a superior twin room was extremely small </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Unfortunately the information about the Parking facilities at the hotel was ehm misleading to say the least We decided to go there by car as I relied on the information provided by Booking com that among the list of the hotel facilities there was parking as well I drove for almost six hours from central Europe only to find out upon arrival that there is no hotel parking but some third party parking space around 300 m from the hotel The hotel stuff reacted immediately to my complaint and I received their apologies for the trouble together with a room upgrade On the evening of the second day and when we returned to our room I even found an apologizing letter from the hotel manager and a treat waiting there An email from him was sent as well stating their will to correct the information For me that would be the most important thing to do It is about transparency and trust </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The overall experience at the hotel was good considering that we were looking for a comfortable but not expensive hotel close to the center In this respect NH Touring hotel in Milano met our expectations </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> don t order the steak at the restaurant You can have tastier less overdone steak elsewhere Stick to a standard room its just as good as the deluxe if not better </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The breakfast was generous and very good and the environment classy and clean I also liked the fact that the hotel was not actually in the center of all the action but a short ride from my conference and all amenities It was a good quiet place and nice not to see any dodgy characters on the street check in and check out was super quick and its worth it to take the cab to Central station no point carrying a big bag all the way down the street </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> This hotel is situated in an excellent location and the staff are lovely However it is not a 4 star hotel and it is expensive for what it is The facilities are very dated in particular the bed and pillows are extremely uncomfortable the mini bar fridge is very hot does not chill the contents at all and is not properly installed so it comes out of the cupboard when you open the door the air conditioning unit is SO NOISY that it would be impossible to sleep with it on luckily I had earplugs the wardrobe door was broken the furniture is very dated If you want a basic hotel that is in a good location the Acevi is great however don t be fooled it is not a 4 star hotel </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Rooms are really small and there is no privacy when going to the bathroom Due to lack of proper air flow in the bathroom everything feel wet constantly Make sure you leave the sign to clean the room when going out if you want service It seems that if you don t there is no service and with the above issue in the bathroom you most probably will want to have the room cleaned every day The walls are also quite thin so you can hear everything your neighbors are doing or saying Breakfast is quite sad for the price requested especially the coffee seems to be drawn directly from the Thames river and the air conditioning in that area blows air directly from the North Pole I also highly recommend that a notice is given before the windows are cleaned so that the customers will not present themselves au naturel to the window cleaners </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel looks really nice The concept of profit going to helping people in need is also a BIG plus It is also close to DRL meaning that it is easy to reach the city center and you have a Tesco right in front of the hotel European plugs and USB chargers in the room are also a welcomed surprise </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Bathroom door handle was broken couldn t shut the door Weak shower not acceptable for 200 superior room Breakfast was incredibly busy had to wait to be seated Cold beans cold mushrooms soggy hash browns Couldn t get a proper coffee like a latte or cappuccino instead staff were walking around with jugs of instant coffee that was horrible It shouldn t be unreasonable to expect a good shower and decent cup of coffee in a 4 star hotel in London especially at the price paid for breakfast which can buy you 5 better breakfast and decent drinkable coffee in any cafe in town </Negative_Review>

		<Negative_Review> My only criticism was that housekeeping arrived late in the day to make up my room generally around 4 00 or 4 30pm I was normally out of the hotel most of the day since my trip was primarily business but I arrived back at the hotel around 3 30 4 00 a time when I really needed access to the room 4th floor It was for me an inconvenient time for housekeeping to make up the room Not a major issue and I would strongly recommend the hotel </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The hotel is an exceptional contemporary design with an iconic view of Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament It is modern and comfortable with a highly professional staff It has several good restaurants Service in general was top notch </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The drinks are what we didn t like The coffee at breakfast was not too good but the others from the self service were even worse The biggest let down of all was the cocktails and bar staff Every cocktail we ordered was a poor concoction or imitation and the bar staff stood idly around while we tried to get their attention The only time we got served was when you actually went to the bar and to add insult to injury they added a service charge to the bill What service </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The rooms are good in size and of a high spec while being value for money and centrally located The staff are very courteous and helpful with nothing being too much trouble We arrived at 11am while check in was not till 2pm but we were greeted with smiles at all times and the staff still gave us a room as one was available Food was good especially the sushi Breakfast was of a large variety to cater for all tastes so there was plenty of choice too </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The price inflated to over 3 times the normal rate for the fortnight because it is near the Wimbledon tennis event At 200 the deluxe double was disappointing having only the small round window at the front for natural light At over 3 times the price it was outrageously expensive Advantage well and truly taken The staff bored uninterested and far too few of them at breakfast On one morning we waited 30 minutes to get our drinks The few staff there were like headless chickens Slightly better on the second day as there fewer guests but still very poor Some tables were set properly ours wasn t Not fun eating cereal with a teaspoon Eggs not cooked as I requested When we arrived at our room there was a huge pile of laundry just outside the door not a good look on arrival At check out we weren t even asked how we enjoyed our stay just as well as the bored reception clerk was answering the phone It was a two star experience for 5 star prices </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Very handy for Wimbledon tennis event and cars were available to transport guests around Comfortable bed </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The airconditioning was noisy inefficient This hotel is used a great deal for weddings residents are at times unable to use the Orangery Breakfast can be a problem when the wedding party are breakfasting as it results in long waits for other guests I feel more staff need to be used when this situation is happening </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Excellent position for meeting family in Wimbledon Village The room was very good excellent parking facility The recent makeover was very tasteful No problems with hot water EExcellent to have fresh milk in the fridge daily </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> The mattress was very squashy and could have done with an extra 2 pillows as we only had 1 each Also the room was only cleaned for the first 3 days of our stay and not on the last 2 unsure why possibly our error as maybe we needed to place the hanging sign on the front of our door for it to be cleaned but this didn t seem the case for the first 3 days </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Absolutely loved the fact that we had a coffee machine it was a really good addition to our stay Also we were on the 12th floor and the views over Amsterdam were absolutely stunning </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Although clean bathroom was in need of several repairs shower door was a folding device that missed a hinge or two and collapsed into one s standing room while showering No outlet in bathroom no mirror in room itself No air conditioner although fan provided View of courtyard just a hallow area between buildings nothing scenic Not an overly comfortable bed neither of us slept well Note that restaurant while reputedly very good closes for a month each summer as of about 23 July Parking in their underground garage must be reserved in advanced If you don t see this option when booking your hotel room consider calling the hotel to arrange as nearest parking garage cost us a fixed fee of 35 Euro and the garage only opens each morning at 9 am </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Hotel is a period piece that is well situated near a metro stop It is very clean and in overall good shape if dated Staff reasonably friendly </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Sent email twice before my arrival asking to arrange rooms as close to each other as possible Rooms were accommodated miles away on the same floor though Repair works every morning starting at 8am above our Standard twin room level with unbearable noise But since we were out whole day from 9 to 7 I did not ask to change it Overall quality of Standard Twin was way below 4 it felt like you were in different hotel Paying extra for health facilities was inconvenient </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> Stayed at Executive Double and Standard Twin rooms with family Executive one was newly refurbished and great I would recommend it to anyone without reservation Great location nice breakfast and lobby comfortable beds cleanliness and a good value for money overall Reception staff was nice and helpful </Positive_Review>

		<Negative_Review> Even though we didn t pay to much for our stay the room was really small You couldn t actually have two people in the bathroom at the same time That being said as we were only there for one night and out and about all day it really didn t bother us </Negative_Review>
		<Positive_Review> The staff were so friendly I left my coach tickets in my room after check out and didn t realise until a few hours later I rang the hotel who found them and left them with the concierge for me to collect later I was quite impressed Location was great plenty of places to eat and the tube is right at the top of the street </Positive_Review>
