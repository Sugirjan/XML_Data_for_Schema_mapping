		<Wine_name>Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Prap&#243;  (Barolo)</Wine_name>
		<Wine_variety>Nebbiolo</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>70.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Ugni Blanc-Colombard</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>9.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>59.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This Pinot Noir is from the far or &#8220;true&#8221; Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>18.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Gr&#252;ner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This notable Gew&#252;rtz starts with an aromatic, fresh fruit nose&#8212;melon, flowers&#8212;tinged with spice. On the palate, the wine offers an elegant array of white fruit, citrus and spice flavors and a shot of balancing acidity. The wine offers complexity but is also fun and refreshing, not perfumy or heavy.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Riesling</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>18.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage. Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>19.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This Tempranillo is a heavy, saturated number with rubbery plum and berry aromas. It's totally Argentinean in style and shares little to nothing with Spanish versions; it's full bodied but not showing much in the midpalate, while generic berry flavors offer chocolate notes and finish short.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip.</Wine_Description>

Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years. The acidity and the rich fruit combine with the fine dusty tannins. The wine will surely not be ready to drink before 2027.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This second wine of Ch&#226;teau de Belcier has a good texture, jammy ripe strawberry fruits and light tannins. A wine with acidity and a character, it will be ready to drink soon. Drink from mid-2016. MACIF, a mutual insurance company, bought the estate in the 1980s and restored the vineyards and ch&#226;teau that was built by Fran&#231;ois de Belcier, a counter-revolutionary who was guillotined in 1794.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Intensely smoky, dusty mineral aromas on this Riesling dissipate with aeration to reveal a delightful bouquet of white blossoms and stonefruit. The palate is bright with citrus acidity and sweet yellow cherries. While lively and fresh now, it should develop remarkable complexity over the next 5&#8211;7 years.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Port</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>75.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.</Wine_Description>

The mouthfeel is creamy and the wine balanced, with buttery highlights around jicama and green-apple fruit. Despite the low alcohol, it's ripe enough to feel full bodied.</Wine_Description>

Grown in northeastern Greece on an ancient site overlooking the Aegean Sea, this is smooth and velvety with rich, spicy flavors and a lingering finish. Its texture and complexity lends it to pairings with more opulent dishes like rack of lamb and beef stew, but alternately, consider its Mediterranean roots and sip alongside a plate of spicy black olives or a Greek salad.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>A good effort from a weak vintage. This Bierzo has sweet, rich, fulfilling aromas along with a soothing palate that's not overly acidic. As a whole, the wine's cola and blackberry flavors show themselves nicely, while the finish is chocolaty and long. A good wine from a sketchy year.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.</Wine_Description>

The nose, sweeter and slightly headier than the un-treated version, leads into a pretty, rounded fruit profile that marries the oaky spice and lemon character well. More dimension and less lift than the average Greek white.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Vanilla and fig hints add interest to this medium-bodied, richly textured wine. It's quietly fruity, suggesting honeydew melon, and has complex layers that unfold on the palate. It's a very good example of how this grape variety thrives in Lake County.</Wine_Description>

Right now, the wine smells young and a bit closed, hiding some of its beauty and nuance behind the upfront black plum, cassis and cherry fruit aromas. Hints of fruitcake spice, bramble, cigar box and leather occasionally flicker in the background, revealing what time has in store for this dark beauty of a wine. Big and rich right now, with a full structure and gripping tannins. Drink 2016&#8211;2022.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>38.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>From northeast-facing vineyards that catch morning sun at 1,200 feet, this is micro-terroir grapegrowing at its most extreme. Cool weather has yielded crisp acidity and fruit that runs the razor's edge between raspberry ripeness and mint-and-tomato earthiness. Very fine barrels add smoke, spice, vanilla and oak-modulated roundness. It seems to lack depth, but then so do certain Burgundies in their youth. &#8212;S.H.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carr&#233;, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4&#8211;5 years.</Wine_Description>

Based on a couple of older vintages, this wine should last at least 7&#8211;8 years from the vintage, but I find them most attractive in their youth.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Winemaker: Carl Schultz. This is one well-balanced Cab, aged for 19 months in 75% new and 25% second fill French oak. It's warm and spicy upfront, leading with pleasant aromas of brambly berry compote, cassis, licorice root, charred tree bark and a touch of chocolate brownie. The palate is soft and smooth on entry, with rich, concentrated black-fruit flavors, but structured tannins pick up and lend serious grip to the long, spicy finish. A wine that should continue to develop well, drink 2021&#8211;2025.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Riesling</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>85.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this&#8212;it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age. The pure, long and intense finish is a delicious promise. Drink 2017&#8211;2037.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>A big blanket of oaky, chocolaty, minty aromas sits on top of herbal plum and cassis scents. No surprise that this is a big wine with loud plum, blackberry and spice flavors, but it's also a bit awkward in feel. On the finish, this spreads apart at the seams, leaving no cushion for scorching acidity and hard tannins. Drink through 2021.</Wine_Description>

Aged in both French and American oak, it impresses from the get-go, with intense notes of blackberry, black licorice and dark chocolate. It's dense yet balanced on the finish.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Chardonnay</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>17.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Not a cookie-cutter wine, this tastes very alive and exuberant. It offers an aroma like fresh-baked scones, with very tangy flavors like orange and pineapple. That also makes it lively in texture, with lots of bright acidity derived from the grapes. Slightly nutty nuances develop on the finish, which is exceptionally long. It's a rare wine that has no added sulfites.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>40.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Seven Hills and Les Collines provide the grapes for this 80-20 Cab-Merlot blend. The cool 2011 vintage was especially noticeable in Walla Walla&#8212;here expressed as light strawberry and cranberry fruit, caught in a shell of acid. The wine ultimately turns tannic, with light barrel flavors of caramel and mocha. More bottle age may help to further meld the components.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>The people at Hidalgo in Sanl&#250;car have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque.</Wine_Description>

The palate is wonderfully taut and tight, fresh and precise and displays a wonderful Riesling contradiction: a bone-dry taut wine can be laser-like on the palate and yet have whirls of rich rounded expansive flavors. Here they are of citrus zest, yarrow, lanolin and pure lemon oil. Savor this slowly and feel enriched. Drink now through 2030.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>One of the iconic wines of Portugal, the brand dates back to the 15th century and the Portuguese discovery of Brazil. In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness. The structure is all there in what is still a young wine. With power and a dense texture, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost manages to coax stunning aromas and unique flavors from his sparkling wines. In this example, the nose offers pear cider and corn laced with lime and apple aromas. That cider element comes into play on the palate as well, where mulling spices blend with dried ginger for a full and intriguing sip.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Pinot Noir</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>78.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>The mighty Hirsch rises to the occasion of a burly, near-perfect vintage, showing off its ability to be brawny and brainy at the same time. Black fruit, tar and tea take center stage, with an intensely tannic underbelly specked in wild herb and smoke. This baby needs time. Drink now after decanting or cellar through 2023.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Notes of burnt caramel hover above the glass but on the palate precision reigns. A frame of earthiness and zest still shrouds the fruit. This wine will take time to open up but has a promising core of concentrated flavor and a backbone around which layered flavors of pear and quince will express themselves. The earthy pear and citrus zest notes are full of promise. Drink 2018&#8211;2030.</Wine_Description>

Drinking at or near its peak, this opens with slightly oxidized apple fruit, and gains further richness as it winds through a finish with excellent length and flavor.

		<Wine_variety>Ros&#233;</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>24.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three ros&#233;s made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.</Wine_Description>

The flavors convey both power and finesse with a spot-on sense of balance and a long finish that kicks it up a notch. It's drinking beautifully now but has a long life in front of it.

		<Wine_Price>45.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>150.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>You'll find aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, truffle, grilled herb and a balsamic note on this robust red. The brawny palate evokes dried black cherry, prune, licorice and tobacco alongside chewy tannins and the heat of evident alcohol. Let the muscular tannins unwind for a few more years then drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance.

		<Wine_variety>Red Blend</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>59.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Roasted and fiery on the nose, this wine has red fruit aromas mixed with green, herbal notes. It feels racy and pumped up with acidity, which drives the wine's core flavors of red plum, herb and vanilla. It's fresh but slightly abrasive and herbal throughout. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Tempranillo, in descending order.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>75.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This majority Merlot, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, is elegant in sandalwood and cedar, offering a taste of cassis and dried herb atop integrated yet sizable tannins. French oak, half of it new, encased the wine for a little more than two years, adding to its power and structure. Drink now through 2021.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers. It offers so much to think about, from its lemony-crisp and tangy palate to its chalky tannins. Full bodied, it merits attention, veering from herbal to chocolaty in one sip.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9&#8211;10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>39.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>There's an elegant blend of red cherry, rose petal and purple-flower aromas on the nose of this wine. The palate is even more exquisitely layered, with espresso, dark red cherry, black plum, mission fig, North African spice and a touch of mint, all hung on a solid tannic structure.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Chardonnay</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>25.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>The cool conditions that defined the 2011 vintage in Chile are draped all over this Chardonnay. The nose deals notes of applesauce and oaky cinnamon, while the palate is sleepy, with very little happening. Flavors of spicy oak rest on top of white fruit flavors, and the finish is neutral and acidic.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Grands Terroirs is a brand created by Cahors-based Ch&#226;teau le C&#232;dre. This bow to its Bordeaux neighbor has produced a Pauillac that is classic, rich, structured and packed with blackberry fruit. It is still on the young side, although drinkable, a wine that will open and round in the next two years.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030.</Wine_Description>

The bouquet is mostly popcorn atop apple and pear, while the flavor profile is ripe apple and banana. The finish is soft and creamy, with flavors of lemon and fresh-cut wood. Fine acidity and balance work in its favor.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Petit Verdot and Syrah. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, fig, dried fruit and vanilla are reserved while the red- and black-fruit flavors are rich but deft, with the tannins providing some heft. It seems a bit more evolved than its age might suggest.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Yes, the same Jacob's Creek that turns out vast quantities of drink-me-now wines at sub-$10 price points also makes this age-worthy Cabernet from Coonawarra fruit. The 2008 is a harmonious wine, blending notes of cassis, cigar box and vanilla into a richly textured, fairly tannic whole. Give it 4&#8211;5 years in the cellar.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Price>48.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>While tinged with savory complexities of wet earth, spice and game, this densely structured Cabernet Franc is anchored by a core of ripe blackberry and black cherry flavors. Zesty acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins lend a tightness of structure that should hold up well through 2025.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>A blend of 70% Marsanne and 30% Roussanne, this is unusually aromatic for a white Hermitage, with perfumed notes of pineapple and melon underscored by hints of graphite. It's plump on the midpalate and custardy-rich in texture, yet focused and long on the finish. Drink now, or sometime after 2017.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Red Blend</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>20.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>Blackberry, vanilla, a hint of chemical and generic darkness drive the nose on this muscular, black-tinted blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 9% Syrah. The palate is grabby and fiercely tannic, while blackberry, herb and molasses flavors finish in heady, tannic, warm fashion.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Petite Sirah</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>29.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This engaging, multilayered, flavorful and nuanced wine has subtle aromas like black pepper and grilled meat. Flavors suggest ripe Bing cherries and blackberries, while the seductive mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Aged 20 months in American oak barrels, the wine has great structure and will improve through at least 2020.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Pinot Noir</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>68.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>This is significantly lighter than the 2010 edition, both in color and in flavor. Red apple and tart cherry fruit combines into a wine with plenty of acidity. There's a flavor of cracker running through the core, and continuing after the fruit fades away.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_variety>Pinot Noir</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>25.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>A nutty undertow finds its way in this wine, which is marked by an earthiness of sage, clove and sous bois. Funky and desirable, it leans medium-bodied in weight and tone, with an undeniable affront of blood orange and crisp red cherry.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_name>Bonair 2006 Chateau Puryear Vineyard Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills)</Wine_name>
		<Wine_variety>Merlot</Wine_variety>
		<Wine_Price>20.0</Wine_Price>
		<Wine_Description>The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced. The fruit suggests pomegranate and very tart raspberry, with plenty of acid; the oak layers in thick flavors of espresso and chocolate. Tannins are stiff but not too rough; and the finish suggests that some American oak mayhave been used.</Wine_Description>

		<Wine_Description>Fresh and fruity, this is full of red cherry flavors and crisp acidity. It has some age, hinting at a more toasty future. For the moment, it's at its best after eight years aging on the lees in the bottle.</Wine_Description>
