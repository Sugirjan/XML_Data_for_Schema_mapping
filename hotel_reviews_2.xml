		<Bad> I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer </Bad>
		<Good> Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful </Good>

		<Bad> Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves </Bad>
		<Good> Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom </Good>

		<Bad> When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel is great The staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that I will visit the hotel again The room superior double 5th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard Considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops Very clean good sleep And I liked it aesthetically It has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel I would definitely recommend it </Good>

		<Bad> The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff </Bad>
		<Good> Beautiful building courtyard was stunning Marvellous location just a short walk from Temple tubestation along the Thames very pretty The staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday They delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special The lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it The design of the space left a long lasting impression The rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee </Good>

		<Bad> Booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible However I found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay More than 350 GPB for 8 nights Communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price Booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee Booking com refunded me 352 GBP the difference in the price Thank you Booking com for keeping the promise </Bad>

		<Good> Breakfast was definitely one of the best parts of this hotel To be able to get up in the morning with two kids and have a full breakfast made was invaluable My kids could not get enough of Agatha one of the breakfast hosts she was fantastic Which made the mornings a breeze </Good>

		<Good> The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious </Good>

		<Bad> Instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful The room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms I have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space I found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay At checkout time the staff were politely informed that I could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst I went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from London which was most appreciated Overall I had an enjoyable stay at the Grand Royale London Park Hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to London </Good>

		<Bad> We had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that I was male he proceeded to imply that I was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way This attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that Novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors To make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room Authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore I m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately Although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint The contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms The bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small The water ran hot and cold intermittently For some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa The aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope </Bad>
		<Good> Reception area restaurant and bar very contemporary the wifi was very good as was the breakfast The staff in the bar area were excellent especially the mixologist and waiter who were very friendly helpful and informative </Good>

		<Bad> The staff are fairly up themselves I didn t feel particularly welcome My room was substandard Yes it looks very trendy and I can t fault that you do get an iron decent hair dryer iPhone dock as standard However The sink in the middle of the room is a novelty to be cool but is fairly annoying and inconvenient The showerhead sprayed in all directions clearly needing a decent de scaling The automatic light also didn t go out in the shower room neither did the fan It wasn t the best night sleep I ve had in a hotel The location is noisy Particularly on a Saturday night You are right next to china town and Leicester Square Expect lots of noise from outside Unfortunately it extends inside too as the bar is popular with the early 20 s crowd dressed up to the hills all thinking they are being exclusive and classy by paying over the odds for cocktails so it s busy and noisy in the communal areas Be warned if you want a late drink at the hotel bar you will be battling with the public to get served and the bar staff are quite slow Being all male behind the bar on the night I was there meant all the pretty young girls were getting served first and i stood there growing ever more annoyed at being ignored I did asked to switch rooms for my second night which was met with a look of inconvenience Almost as though they hadn t ever been asked this before They didn t particularly apologise for the genuine problems with my room It was a Sunday night and I know they had lots of empty rooms It was hardly a big request Any tourists staying here please take note NOT to use their car service It is outrageous what they charge I did a 7 min journey due to bad weather and was charged 18 Being from south London I know that should have cost around 5 8 max You will be much better off walking 30 secs to the main road and getting a black cab or downloading uber Don t let them rip you off </Bad>
		<Good> The location It s very modern and looks good You can easily get anywhere from this location The rooms are smart and overall it does feel impressive but beauty is only skin deep </Good>

		<Bad> The linens weren t very soft and some of the pillows were rock hard so the beds could have been more comfortable It was a very cold weekend and a bit of chill did seem to get through the window frames The hotel is good value but I prefer the vibe of the Renaissance St Pancras </Bad>
		<Good> Traveling with two young children the pullout couch was small but sufficient and I liked how it had a separate space and TV Room was clean and modern Location is great Staff were very friendly and helpful </Good>

		<Bad> The hotel is over priced We paid 485 00 US per night for the room</Bad>
		<Good> This is a very nice hotel with a fantastic location Connects to Victoria station so if you are flying out of Gatwick you can walk through the back door of the hotel into the station and catch the express to the airport The location is also a 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace 15 minute walk to Westminster Abbey and a 20 minute walk to Big Ben and Parliament It is an older hotel but has been remodeled and upgraded and is very nice Rooms are much larger than you would think and the bed is very comfortable Bathrooms in some rooms are much larger than others Staff was great </Good>

		<Bad> The shower is ultra modern Maybe some directions for adjusting water temperature would be a good safety idea Also there needs to be a rubber mat in the bottom of the shower I did slip a little getting out as there is nothing to hold on to Also there is a step up into the bathroom from the bedroom which is unmarked I tripped over it twice before remembering it was there </Bad>
		<Good> Beautiful little hotel near Lancaster Gate tube station It has a lift It has air conditioning Most hotels I stay at in London has neither It has a charming area called the Library that serves drinks and snacks I loved the period detail in the architecture The staff were friendly and efficient The room where I stayed was very quiet unusual for a 200 year old building </Good>

		<Bad> Generally I had the impression that the business model of this hotel is additional services I would not recommend the single room the city view on booking com was a wall 6ft away and the room seemed to be built around the bed I could upgrade the room for 30 just like I could upgrade my breakfast for 6 5 to match the pictures on booking com Generally low ceilings very narrow hallways to maximise the number of rooms </Bad>

		<Bad> The breakfast is a bit overpriced Not much to complain about other than that </Bad>
		<Good> This was a great little find in a lovely district the hotel is tastefully done and we were lucky to get upgraded to a Superior suite The staff was very friendly and pleasant in sharp contrast to another hotel we stayed at the first time we visited Paris The hotel even has a little cinema screen and a list of movies to choose from The bar is nice and there are plenty of board games to choose from All these mattered because we happened to visit Paris on the weekend of the multiple terrorist attacks across the city The hotel was therefore our little refuge Will definitely be going back </Good>

		<Bad> We booked adjacent deluxe rooms We were put into adjacent standard rooms It was only because I noticed the mistake that it was acknowledged However due to the hotel occupancy level and being late in the afternoon it wasn t possible to provide the rooms we had paid for and with only 2 days in Paris we lost over an hour of our first day trying to remedy the situation Compensation was offered but at the time of writing this the refund that was promised has not happened </Bad>
		<Good> Excellent location comfy beds quiet Jenna the general manager was very helpful in trying to fix the issues that arose however the problems we had shouldn t have happened in the first place</Good>

		<Bad> The blanket albeit comfy is quite thick and heavy and we ended up feeling pretty warm at night despite switching the air conditioning to the lowest temperature </Bad>
		<Good> We were on our honeymoon and they upgraded us to the Tower Bridge Suite What a lovely gesture The staff were very attentive to any queries that we had and the hotel is located within a 5 min walking distance to the Tower of London Very convenient </Good>

		<Bad> Pool spa facilities were out of order both days we were there and this was a big reason I chose the hotel in the first place I was only offered an alternative 10 minute walk to another location s pool on the second day in the evening so that didn t help much The first day it was implied we would get some complimentary drinks food to make up for it but we didn t receive this either Considering how crucial the wellness area was in my decision to book the hotel it was very disappointing that it wasn t available and even though I know unexpected issues and maintenance can happen I would have expected an effort to make up for it </Bad>

		<Bad> There s no parking around the hotel the nearest ncp is a 15 minute walk However it s free parking after 6 on back roads and free on Sunday s so I guess you could time it right to be closer to the hotel The guy at check in was a bit clueless and I had to help him out I spend a lot it time at hotels for work to speed up the process I also find it bizarre to be in London and people do not understand me while I m speaking English Everything else was fantastic</Bad>
		<Good> The hotel is gorgeous The rooms are spotless and stylish the food is great the amenities are next to non and it s a walking distance to local bars restaurants I definitely will go back and stay a lot longer </Good>

		<Bad> Overly techy too much technology going on Lights curtains tv all tied into one tablet on the bed side table which you cant remove from the stand meaning you have to get out of bed to change the channel or do anything the bedside lamp needs to be switched off at the mains Always a lag on the touch pads to do anything Came away with a sore back due to the bed being mega soft and spongy Spent the last night sleeping on the floor Also 29 for a breakfast Really Is the bacon from unicorns Are the beans magic </Bad>
		<Good> Lovely looking hotel couldnt fault the staff at all they really couldnt have been more helpful The views we had from 13th floor were amazing so can only imagine what they would be like from higher The rooms were well kitted out and very clean Excellent location as bus stops within metres and tube is a short 5 min walk away </Good>

		<Bad> It would have been good if the email confirmation had indicated the closest Underground stop with instructions from there very easy since you just walk straight down the same road We did not have WiFi or phone when we were trying to figure out how to get there from Heathrow We asked at the Underground They directed us to switch at West Hampstead to a National Line train That worked but we had to walk between the Underground and other train before boarding then wait again over 10 minutes so it would have been much better to do as the hotel instructed us use the Kilburn Underground station and one of the frequent busses if desired We had the address from the confirmation email but no note of the Underground stop We had no phone available either </Bad>
		<Good> The bed was very comfortable The swimming pool had long hours 7 AM to 10 PM was heated and was a great way to start the day There were many good restaurants within walking distance and although the walk to the Underground was several blocks it was pleasant and we could very easily have hopped on one of the frequent busses had the weather been bad </Good>

		<Bad> No complaints </Bad>
		<Good> I was traveling alone for business I loved the building and it s history Every single staff member was helpful and the service was excellent Everyone I encountered went way beyond what was expected to provide first class service and an enjoyable experience The two nights I dined alone in the restaurant the manager and waiters were friendly and conversive and I never felt like I was on my own The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and were always spotless after cleaning The outside bar was a great place to have a drink I could not be happier with my stay and I look forward to my next visit </Good>

		<Bad> The room smelt of old stale smoke It was a none smoking floor so it was either the airconditioning filters that needed changing or the room was close to an external vent where people were smoking The room was on the 10th floor so it wasn t close to an outside smoking area Very puzzling Also the furniture and decor in the room was looking scratched marked and aged Though the room was clean it certainly was overdue for a refurbishment considering it s a 4 hotel in Canary Wharf </Bad>

		<Bad> Everything else The room had not been cleaned properly after the previous guest There was urine on the toilet seat and nail clippings on the carpet Disgusting I called house keeping who did not even bother answering the phone I called the concierge who sent 2 people up They cleaned the toilet and vacuumed said sorry and left When something like that happens one wonders what else hasn t been cleaned that one doesn t know about The tap in the basin was broken On the landing at the lift there were beer bottles left out There was also a sculpture with old chewing gum stuck on it I don t know why the hotel doesn t simply increase the room rate and offer free wifi in the rooms </Bad>

		<Bad> The location is a short journey away from the main attractions however the tube station is about 300m away and it s only a 5 15min journey costing 1 80 each to anywhere in Paria so I wouldn t say it s a negative For our budget this was perfect and I d stay again The tube is so reliable </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel was so nice to come back to after a busy day of exploring Paris I liked how close it was to the tube station Porte De Champerret I think that s spelt correctly would have been useful to know beforehand which stop it was Comfy bed nice clean bathroom with complimentary shampoo soap etc A very chic boutique it feels very Parisian and the staff were very helpful </Good>

		<Good> Nice stylish hotel Location is great the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the tube station and 10 minutes walk from the British Museum and the west end A very handy small fridge in the room with free water and milk provided The hotel also provide free pack of light breakfast for each guest </Good>

		<Good> The property was across the street from the underground and close to many of the sights we were interested in so location was great The staff was extremely helpful Room was very clean breakfast was very good with good variety The warm chocolate chip cookies were to die for When we checked out we accidentally left our passports in the room and didn t realize it for 24 hours The Staff got them located for us and held them while we got back to London I can t say enough about how helpful their staff was </Good>

		<Bad> I did not like the very cold room I was assigned to I called reception who dispatched a maintenenace staff member who vacuumed the air filter which was totally clogged This did help the air flow to a large extent but did not increase the temperature to a comfortable Are all of your air filters as filthy as this was It is a health issue as you will realise I have not rated the cleanliness of the room as the room itself was all right and the housekeeper should not be held responsibel for the state of the filthy air conditioner </Bad>
		<Good> I appreciated the dining room and reception staff They were very helpful The concierge was absolutely excellent in dealing with an issue I had with my first room He inspected it and confirmed that it was too cold to be in and arranged to have me stay in a h Hilton room which was warm clean and satisfactory If he had not done this I would have gone to another hotel for the night </Good>

		<Bad> The breakfast was nice but not nearly worth 18 euro It was nice but better to have half that price Also should have had coffee tea and kettle in the room Finally we were in room 55 and the water pipes woke me early each day made the hangovers harder to overcome when I woke at 7am each day </Bad>
		<Good> The staff were amazing Without a doubt they were the friendliest happiest and most helpful in any hotel They were fun and funny too Not stiff and formal but relaxed and seemed to really think about what we might need Offered a bottle of water to take out with us on a hot day is a great touch </Good>

		<Bad> I didn t like the fact that when we booked we wasn t informed that the whole building was covered in scaffolding and white sheets This meant that the view from our first room of Trafalgar Square was blocked and we just looked at scaffolding Would have been nice to have been told when we booked as the whole reason we booked was for the lovely views and the roof top bar which may I add was out of use too </Bad>

		<Bad> The room was rather gloomy the decor seemed dated instead of period style a little shabby Marks on the carpet draws in the desk didn t fit the cover to the information brochure was ripped This may seem trivial but these details are things which seemed as if it didn t matter to the hotel which makes a guest feel under valued Half an hour before check out on Monday morning the room phone rang checkout was shouted at me I couldn t understand what else was said but this seemed rather officious given I had every intention of checking out on time Things like this need to be finessed </Bad>
		<Good> Quiet room which I d requested at the back of the hotel 4th floor The first room I was given was at the front which was opposite building work in the street Comfortable bed Lovely staff particularly Zoe every hotel should have a Zoe She did her best to find me a better room for a second time which wasn t possible in the end but she was great I was also impressed with the barman who served us on the Monday night Didn t get his name but he was really attentive</Good>

		<Bad> Solarium room had a few odd features My 82 yr old mother really didn t enjoy the long steps up to the door and there is no hand rail for the steep internal steps down from the door to the beds and bathroom facilities The window against which one of the twin beds was situated was cold at night my mother covered it with her pillow The room was crowded for two people with no bedside tables and one electrical outlet around a corner in an inaccessible desk area for lamp radio kettle hair dryer phone and laptop chargers Hot water tap in the toilet basin was not functional turned on </Bad>
		<Good> The breakfast was fresh and nice The shower was good and hot and we liked the beds and bedding once we d untucked everything so we could get in People were friendly </Good>

		<Bad> Although the staff were not rude they weren t terribly friendly It was a bonjour and straight to the point and you were lucky if you got a smile this applied to every single member of staff I spoke to at the hotel A simple how are you or how was your journey isn t too much to ask On our third day there my sister was very unwell with a cold I rang up reception and asked for a bottle of water to which she replied you have had your one free bottle for the stay you will have to come down and pay for one I then pleaded that my sister was unwell and so the lady asked me to call housekeeping who did not pick up I m not sure how to describe how frustrating it was that a hotel would not give me one bottle of water when somebody was ill without me having to beg for it and even then I didn t receive it and had to walk down to the local shop I didn t bother complaining at reception because the staff were not approachable at all It s really a shame because it s a fantastic location and the staff really do just give me a negative connotation of mercure hotels now and I would hesistate before booking one again </Bad>

		<Bad> The only problem if it could be called a problem was that the music in the lifts was rather loud and did not seem to fit with the otherwise quiet ambience of the hotel s reception and room areas </Bad>
		<Good> The room was very spacious and bed comfortable The room which had originally been booked had a bathtub shower and I had some difficulty in getting in and out Therefore I made a request to reception for a room with walk in shower and this was provided quickly and efficiently with help being given in moving our luggage to the other allocated room </Good>

		<Bad> Range of cereals at breakfast and limited choice of fruit No unflavoured yoghourt Could not find any ordinary black tea bags they might have been there but finding them among the fruit and other infusions defeated me Note trivial negatives arising from personal preferences the breakfast facilities were perfectly adequate and better than expected </Bad>
		<Good> Beds comfortable room clean and well presented bathroom clean shower good size with powerful water supply WiFi easy to access adequate storage hanging space Facility of access after 23 00 and the general security of the premises and room Surprisingly quiet Friendly personnel Clean bar area used for serving breakfast was impressed that the area had been cleaned so well after noting that it was a well used fashionable bar until late the night before </Good>

		<Bad> I only have a small complaint about the bathroom I know the bathing facilities are designed for a long soak but if you just want a quick shower it s impossible to do this while keeping the floor dry because there s no shower curtain But overall this hotel was nearly perfect </Bad>
		<Good> I m so glad that we stayed here The staff were wonderful the room was so clean the wifi was reliable and the amenities were great We liked having the kitchenette if you re like us exploring supermarkets in a foreign country is always fun and having a microwave makes it possible to enjoy some of your gastronomic discoveries The location was also super convenient Considering the general caliber of hotels in London this one felt like a real gem </Good>

		<Bad> The room next door was extremely loud they might as well have been sat in my room They were loud till 2am so no sleep and there s no sound proofing in the rooms I booked 2 rooms a standard one for my son and an executive room The rooms were both very small Could do with some rules on keeping the noise down after a certain time at night and also maybe a bar area downstairs that s open in the evening to encourage people to have a little drink down in the bar rather than in their rooms </Bad>
		<Good> The staff were friendly Close to all amenities in Earls Court Close to tube station Breakfast was adequate Good for a quick over night stay </Good>

		<Bad> The room I was given was on lower ground so no view other than a wall and fire exit also not the best that when the curtains are open people are passing through and able to see you in bed The worst thing about the room was hearing everyone s toilet flush woke up at 8am with the sound of water trickling in the pipes behind the wall The PDA provided wouldn t work either could have been a great help as well</Bad>
		<Good> The room was decorated beautifully and the bed was one of the comfiest I ve been in Entire hotel was spotless and the staff were great Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Hyde Park and Paddington Bayswater train stations </Good>

		<Good> Room and staff quality was excellent I didn t buy a SIM card since I was only there for a day so the icing on the cake was the free phone with unlimited data and local calls that the hotel provided during the stay It helped me tremendously when I was getting around London using Google maps as needed </Good>

		<Bad> I arrived at the hotel at 1am after a long evening travelling only to be told that there was no room for me I was offered a room at a sister hotel which I had little choice but to accept Transport was provided and staff were friendly but overall I was very disappointed with the experience practice of overselling rooms </Bad>

		<Bad> The hotel told me that my card was declined for security deposit I kept having them re swipe I checked my statement and had been charged five 100 deposits that they said were declined When I went to the front desk to explain I overheard someone having an identical situation It took some time about two weeks for the charges to be removed which was an inconvenience on vacation </Bad>
		<Good> Price was more than reasonable for the area Location was not near to sites but the metro was directly next to hotel and was extremely easy to use The bathroom was modern and the housekeeping ladies were superb </Good>

		<Bad> This was probably the most pathetic excuse of a hotel room that I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some dingy places before The room was the converted former exit to the back yard and the hard floor showed obvious signs of water damage To top it off the bed was tiny only 170 cm long about 5 7 I m not tall but even so my feet were sticking out past the bed Clatter from kitchen and a noise from some electrical motor nearby made it impossible to sleep past seven in the morning If they put you in the tiny room half a set of stairs down from the entrance just say no The other rooms in the hotel might be ok but this room was just horrible </Bad>
		<Good> The staff was friendly the little I had to do with them That I only stayed here for one night </Good>

		<Bad> 1 Only reserve the room designated as small if it is for a child or if you are really desperate There is really very little space and almost none to put clothes let alone to store luggage 2 Very little lounge space area in the building for someone to use in order to avoid staying in the room in my case working inside the room is completely impractical unless you decide to use the bed 3 The basement restaurant area is uncomfortably small and it felt totally cramped at least whenever I tried to use it 4 There was a waiting line for breakfast which was mediocre </Bad>

		<Bad> This is my second stay at the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile I have reserved a Presidential Suite for one night as I did in the first one On this stay I was given a different Presidential Suite from the last time The decoration on this one was outdated and cold and catered to adults and did not have the best view of Paris While on the previous one the suite was warm and more children friendly with comfortable sofas It also had a beautiful view of Paris the Eiffel Tower and other landmark The most troubling thing on this visit was when my family and I arrived into the suite While everything seemed cleaned and in order however when my wife checked the guest bathroom she immediately noticed that the toilet was used and not cleaned It was appalling I also noticed in the living area a tray with coffee and mugs I thought it was a welcoming gesture but when I checked carefully there was coffee in the mugs and it has been used I immediately went to the front desk and reported my complaint and asked for another suite Unfortunately the other ones were all taken So the front desk promised me that they will get the bathroom cleaned and the tray picked up immediately However 40 minutes later housekeeping did not show up and I had to call again until they showed up this time around Needless to say there were no apologies from the hotel management and explanation how did this happen or someway to make up for this incident Very disappointing Finally Because the king bed in one of suite bedrooms are large and the bedroom is small the passage between the bed and the closet facing it is very narrow The issue was that the bed stands are made of solid wood and are on the edge of the bed One time when I was walking and about to enter this passage my left foot toe hit the solid wood so hard it was bruised very badly and I could not walk comfortably for two weeks </Bad>

		<Bad> Carpet a little worn out but to be expected in a busy London hotel Sound insulation is definitely inferior compared to likes of Premier Inn you can hear your neighbours and vice versa The room was in the basement or lower ground floor with blackout curtains and some sort of window shade so you could not see outside The lack of natural light meant that if you haven t set your alarm you might wake up as I did at 9am thinking it is still only 4am If you are expected to check out by a certain time this may be problematic Also in the morning without the option of having a window to open you feel as though can hardly breathe and need to escape well before your check out is due We did not pay for the breakfast as for 15 a head this did not represent good value for money in line with the room rate and there were better alternatives elsewhere </Bad>
		<Good> Easy check in Friendly and attentive staff including a phone call we received from the receptionist to the room 5 minutes after check in to ensure we were satisfied with it though perhaps a more personal touch by door knocking wouldn t go amiss but that is just my preference and I expect others prefer to be left alone Compact room size but clever use of space The complimentary fruit and water bottles are a nice touch as well as tea and coffee facilities The overhead shower was a welcome surprise and the bathroom and bedroom decor was first rate or at least what one would expect of a four star hotel The price we paid via booking was also very good value for money </Good>

		<Bad> Although we booked for 2 adults and 2 children 1 baby and requested baby cot the staff were not aware that we did book a family room and did not supply with a cot until later on Unfortunately even then the cot did not have a mattress and the sheets were left inside for us to make it For this reason our baby had to sleep with us in bed which originated not much sleep for mummy as we were afraid she will fall off the bed Disappointing </Bad>

		<Bad> As a frequent traveller I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and would only rate this hotel as a 3 E g No safe in first 2 rooms given although stated on room description soap and shampoo in fixed bottles on wall like a premier inn and no other toiletries in room very low lighting apparently as eco friendly But then had air conditioning that wouldn t turn off and kept us awake all night The staff were just about ok apart from the one gentleman who was trying very hard to find us a suitable room Location and walk to Clapham junction did not feel safe so we used taxis Shuttle bus needed 30mins notice Would definitely not stay here again </Bad>

		<Bad> The room had no curtains and when reported they were aware of it but hadn t sorted it Many complaints and requests to speak to the manager were met with being told to please be patient I had to make some curtains out of a towel bed throw and coat hangers 100 a night for a room that makes Harry Potters cupboard under the stairs look palatial and to bring your own curtains value for money I think not I was informed the manager would contact my by Saturday afternoon 3 days later I m still waiting Some of the staff were rude and almost put out by my complaint a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry is not an acceptable way to treat paying guests This hotel has the potential to be a good one a shake up of staff and some lessons in hospitality and the rooms having the basics should help with that Do not be swayed by the photographs Photoshop has be put to good use here </Bad>

		<Good> We took the Heathrow express to Paddington and the hotel was a short walk away It was right beside Hyde Park and numerous tube stations We actually walked to Oxford Street without realising it Hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff were very willing and helpful Breakfast was a buffet or a full English for a few pounds extra If returning to London I would stay at this property again </Good>

		<Bad> This place was a disappointment The space is tiny and the floor was very dirty They need to deep clean the floors When my family arrived the toilet was broken throughout our stay They had people coming to fix it but it never worked Even with the toilet not working they did not discount me anything The staff there told me that I will receive a receipt at 2pm the same day through my email but I have never received any receipt When I came home I checked my credit card and it turns out they charged me 4 extra transactions a few days after I have already arrived home When I contacted them regarding the receipt and the extra transactions they took more than a day to reply and told me that they discounted me for the toilet by charging me less city tax and there was no mention of extra charges This didn t make sense because they charged me for the hotel and city tax separately The city tax was paid in full so overall it ended up costing me more than what I originally booked on here I tried to contact them again because I do not understand why they are charging me even after my stay when I did not touch any of there stuff And its not even small charges They were about 300 euros for each charge Are you kidding me They still haven t reply about it so I had to call my bank to deal with this matter I am very unhappy with this place and would not reccommend anyone to stay here This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Please take my advice and save yourself the trouble </Bad>

		<Bad> The person who checked me in on the reception desk was miserable and unhelpful Added no value and provided no information passed me a form to sign and the key and didn t even tell me where the room was When I asked simply pointed to the lift He said 2 or three words to me came across rude and in my opinion should never work in a customer service role </Bad>
		<Good> The room was clean spacious and comfortable </Good>

		<Bad> 1 The attitude of the staff except for the concierge sucks major They are all argumentative unhelpful and aggressive in their stance against you I found it a real turn off 2 The air conditioning in the room sucked in spite of having it on Fan Speed 3 and 18C degrees the room was always warm the A C is just old and decrepit It is totally unable to cool down a room 3 Rooms were not ready when promised at all In spite of arriving early and the sour faced russian woman on the front desk pointedly commenting that check in time was 2 pm the rooms were not ready until 2 30 pm 4 One room was supposed to have a double bed they gave us a king They promised to separate the king into two beds never did 5 The second room was supposed to be a King they gave us a queeen promised to find us another room never did 6 The hotel is really far away from the Tube 7 Paid WIFI in this day and era This Millenium is a sad sad hotel Nothing compared to the one in NY which is amazing I am never going to stay in it again Total waste of money </Bad>
		<Good> Honestly nothing was that great The hotel is nice inside but I didn t find anything outstanding </Good>

		<Bad> The bottom sheet on the bed did not fit as it was a lovely pillow top bed but a normal sheet Annoying though with the sheet pulling up all the time and it looks tacky when you can see the mattress Plus my daughter had a baby cot and they did not change her sheets or even fold her sheet for the three nights we were there which I thought was not good enough I could have called about it but it was too late each time we got back and I had to just put her to bed Baby cots should be serviced along with the rest of the room </Bad>
		<Good> The room was lovely and big The beds were excellent The bathroom was nice and modern with a great shower Great location for Tower of London and tower bridge A very enjoyable stay </Good>

		<Bad> Old Space was poor especially with pull out bed open Shower is way to small unless you weigh less then 120lbs Almost got a splinter in my foot from the wood floors that should have been redone 50 years ago Microwave barely worked Was not comfortable for the amount I paid to stay there Then the front desk person when we were leaving was upset I wouldn t fill out a long survey in front of him while the taxi was waiting Then had to charge a minimal 22 Euro city tax on top of the large amount I already paid and wanted us to wait 6 minutes while the charge went through During all this the taxi is running a meter and we were charged 14 Euros higher then what was quoted I barely had enough Euro s left to cover it Bad ending to what was already a mediocre stay </Bad>

		<Bad> We got bumped from this hotel to the Hyde Park Grand in Paddington on what I am sure was the pretext of a boiler problem We were assure it was a better hotel and it would be an upgrade We were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience We had to check in at the Notting Hill hotel paid and were sent by taxi to the Hyde Park Grand We were given a basement room that was so small that we could not both be vertical at the same time One had to go in the bathroom The room was tired and it was not a good experience We did not risk the free breakfast </Bad>

		<Bad> The price If i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but 170 is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for 22 it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money Completely mis sold and completely ripped off </Bad>
		<Good> Unfortunately i struggled to like anything at a push i would say the check in staff and the guy that fetched me the iron ironing board even though that leaked water all over my clothes and the actual ironing board was wonkey i d have to say these were the only positives </Good>

		<Bad> The only problem was that it was an extremely hot evening and there was an ice dispenser which did not dispense any ice This is more an observation than a didn t like as there are very few places that offer that facility </Bad>
		<Good> All the staff at the Radisson Blu are warm friendly We were upgraded which was wonderful The room had a view of the Thames and the bed was extremely comfortable We loved that there are voiles and curtains at the windows for privacy and to block out the light The room had a separate shower and a bath which you don t always get It is the perfect stay for visiting the O2 </Good>

		<Bad> Only complaint is we asked for an iron and it never came Had to ask again and that time they brought it to the room Very minor complaint given the rest of the experience at this hotel The location is great to get around the city but Champs Elysees doesn t offer many great affordable food choices within walking distance Most of the restaurants cafes are either outrageously expensive or not very good Suggest researching and venturing out of the area for that </Bad>
		<Good> Excellent stay Location was great for sight seeing and right near a subway station making it easy to get around the city Person at the front desk was lovely and upgraded us to a deluxe room free of charge The bed was incredibly comfortable Hotel is nice and seemed very clean </Good>

		<Bad> I waited for more than 15 minutes for my luggage to get into my room Finally I went down and take it myself The bathroom door knob was squeaking and the water drainage was making a loud noise for 30 second each time somebody was using it so each morning I was waking up all my family when going to the bathroom I signaled it twice to the reception first time they sent two people to see what is wrong but nothing was fixed and no alternative room was offered This is unacceptable for a five stars hotel After five nights stay I asked to keep the room for two more hours but I was refused I spent the two hours working in the lobby and during this time I have only seen a couple of single individuals checking in I am sure they did not ask for a 4 person room therefore I do not understand the lack of customer focus of the personnel when refusing my request especially after our disappointing customer experience in the previous days that they were aware of </Bad>
		<Good> After giving a 5 EURO tip for 3 pieces of luggage the bellboy was extremely nice and carried our bags to the taxi that was waiting in front of the hotel he smiled and wished us a nice trip back </Good>

		<Good> Great service warm welcome and a free upgrade to a small studio suite The whole place was clean well maintained Parking on site and a district line tube station just a 3 minute walk away The area seemed lovely and friendly even when returning after midnight Lots of shops cafe s and quiet bars close to the hotel if you want an alternative to the super facilities offered by the hotel </Good>

		<Bad> Although a good location there is no tube stop in the immediate vicinity meaning you have to walk 10 mins to get anyway Unusual for a central location A little difficult to find if you don t know your way around The room service carried a hidden charge for having food brought to the room as well as a tip being added on Paid 10 06 for a plate of fries </Bad>
		<Good> Being shown to your room was a nice touch Well kept and quite fancy for the price Staff were friendly and it s a good price for London </Good>

		<Good> The hotel is located very conveniently if you are coming there for an event at Port de Versailles other than that it s not in a good location at all it s on a main street and not in a pleasant area The stuff at the bar was very friendly and helpful </Good>

		<Bad> 1 Star is more than enough for this hotel We arrived me and my husband around 1am and hadnt be late we were to leave to another hotel The second we opened the door it stank of mold and dirt Room 103 hadnt been cleaned for decades everything stank even the bed sheets there were fliplops on the floor from previous guest and floor was covered with white bits The biggest surprise was the Filthy bathroom where there was urine spots on the stool Floor dirty and shower all stained we ended up sitting the rest of the night we couldnt touch anything didnt even take our shoes off Simply Disgusting </Bad>

		<Bad> If you don t like birds then beware each bedroom door has a bird next to the number the lovely toiletries holder has a bird as its handle I loved it but have friends who hate birds Sunday morning breakfast was a disaster Long queue and I counted 7 empty dirty tables with not 1 staff member to be seen to clear these Once I was seated I was not offered tea or coffee There were no bowls for cereal juice had run out as had eggs bacon and some of the pastries Eggs appeared halfway through my breakfast but were cold I appreciate I arrived at an extremely busy time on a Sunday morning but staff seemed too laid back and were in no rush to replenish items with the exception of one male server who seemed to be trying to do everything A server appeared to the table next to me offering coffee and I had to gain her attention for service </Bad>
		<Good> Fabulous shower The best I ve experienced in a long time Bed was very comfortable It was not possible to open a window in the room but the air con was sufficient for a one night stay This may have been the design of the roof as I was on the 7th floor Asian feel to the hotel with all notices in 2 languages </Good>

		<Bad> The age of the hotel building and the design of the rooms each en suite has been added after the fact means that the rooms are very small And when I say small I mean small There is literally no room around a double bed and at best a passage width between the remaining side of the bed and the next wall The bathrooms are also small don t expect a shelf on which to put your toiletries If you are only going to use the hotel as a place to sleep and nothing else then it is manageable for short stays </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel is very well situated and a ten minute walk from two underground stations which will take to you wherever you want in London The hotel itself is in a beautiful Georgian terraced setting and has all the facilities you might need for a short stay in London Everything was very clean and the breakfast was good Recommended for a short stay only for the reasons outlined in the what was not to like section </Good>

		<Good> Contemporary design and smart rooms I loved this futuristic hotel Minimalist rooms without extra space but with all bells and whistles are entirely controlled with an i pad You can even decide how you want your room to feel selecting the mood from the i pad I found extremely interesting the list of all the alternative attractions and restaurants recommended by other guests that you can find scrolling on the i pad The position is ideal to visit the city and to have a great nightlife Shoreditch is particularly recommended to young people it has been subject to considerable gentrification in the past years with accompanying rises in interesting restaurants and bars try Cream for breakfast two minute walk from the hotel </Good>

		<Bad> apart from the bed the room is very functional narrow windows dont open no complimentary water i had issues with A C and also issues with ipad you have to take it away from the dock for it to work but then battery drains quickly or at least that was the case in my room Shower was very low pressure big no no for me I changed rooms it was a little bit better but still very low on the last day my room wasnt cleaned they offered to do it when i was back in the room in the evening but i declined as i didnt want to wait 30 minutes in the lobby </Bad>
		<Good> bed was amazing very big TV had free movies in it which are controlled via ipad lobby area is fantastic great for business drinks staff is amazing and many of the trivial things are free printing for example they even gave me the room for several hours in the afternoon after i checked out so i can wash before the flight bravo blanket very comfy not tucked in also bravo </Good>

		<Good> Excellent hotel located across the road from Tube station Gloucester Road Nice rooms clean great breakfast A huge compliment to the staff who have been extremely helpful when we got stuck in London because of the IT crash at British Airways that caused cancellation of our flight Staff booked us a room for another night with an upgrade and complimentary breakfast and helped us sort out flights and eventually book Eurostar train tickets </Good>

		<Bad> Only downside was hotel staff were not accommodating when we arrived earlier than expected I understand it says the check in time but there was going to be a large cost for checking in 90 minutes early Luckily me and the Mrs had packed our football boots so played a full game then headed in for post match showers Jokes aside though I think this could be worked on a small negative on an otherwise excellent hotel </Bad>

		<Good> Location location location It is very central and a bonus is the park in front of the hotel The view is very nice You can walk covent garden soho even piccadily by walk easily Rooms are comfortable and clean but there is no minibar or safe box </Good>

		<Bad> Had to change to a different room as the first we were given was on the 22nd floor had wet carpets and you could smell the damp I m not sure how long it had been empty but it must have been more than a couple of days Overall the carpets in both rooms as well as the corridors looked a bit worn dirty and in need of replacing Toilet was separate from bathroom and not ideal </Bad>
		<Good> Room generally nice with a very comfy bed memory foam mattress and clean bathroom Sofa bed for the kids OK Hotel is in a great location with friendly staff and about 15 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower Good breakfast worth paying extra as we had kids with us Overall very nice </Good>

		<Bad> The price the need of the debit card that had paid on arrival and the need of a deposit 20 One thing about the room is it had a transparent screen on the wall between the bathroom it could be made less see through but light could still be pass through it we had to switch the light off to have a bath </Bad>
		<Good> the beds were very comfortable I loved how the room was set out and the fact twin beds are available The location is a good one near a whole foods and other shops and the fact room temperature could be easily changed at reception if you wanted I also liked looking out of the window into the street </Good>

		<Bad> Only complaint is the bath tub The plumbing in Paris is not the same as the US so you need patience with the hot water The tub is extremely large and marble So takes a long time to fill But otherwise this hotel is amazing It didn t really matter because the shower is separate and on different plumbing so no issues </Bad>
		<Good> The best thing about the hotel is the staff Very helpful and friendly The manager helped me book a day trip to the champagne region after my online bookings were cancelled twice He set up a more private experience that cost half the price The rooms are extremely comfortable and clean Tons of little extra touches The restaurant is great and lively You need a reservation for dinner because popular for guests and locals alike Breakfast is delicious Nothing feels too cramped like typical Paris hotel The lounge is great to meet for a drink or just to sit </Good>

		<Good> London hotels are hit and miss at best and this one is no different It s a converted something else building The conversion has been well done though Having a small front entrance on a very busy London street meant arriving at night in the rain by car was very difficult There is NO parking the closest parking lot is quite a hike away and VERY expensive 40GPB per day The shower was a little narrow but the water pressure was very good </Good>

		<Good> I booked a suite for myself and two adult daughters as we were attending a family wedding in the City The suite was very spacious had a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and was really like home away from home for the weekend we stayed It was more than adequate for our needs The hotel is in a great location for anyone who wants to take advantage of City sights and above all it is very good value for money Don t be fooled by the small check in desk The hotel provides for all your needs </Good>

		<Bad> The basin overflow was full of bacterial growth and the shower cubicle was similarly unclean These problems are only visible when cleaning teeth or having a shower The shower tiling was also showing signs of coming away directly below the shower taps I would suggest you review your monitoring methodology and instigate a periodic deep clean I wonder if you will actually act on this information </Bad>
		<Good> Yes the croissants were flaky and the bed was comfortable Your staff were polite and friendly I would suggest a review of management policies </Good>

		<Good> Excellent service from all staff I did not use the cafe so I cannot comment on the food Although the rooms are not huge overall they were comfortable I would certainly recommend to friends and stay there again should I visit paris In terms of transport it is just 5 10 mins from two metro stations which offer different lines There were loads of bar cafe and restaurants in the area </Good>

		<Good> It was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore British Museum British Library University of London and very walkable to areas around The double room was small but comfortable for one person It could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily The reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay there again </Good>

		<Bad> Breakfast is expensive and not so good Better go to the nearest cafe or restaurant Printme com service is not actually working or I just wasn t able to figure out how to do it there is no such app where you can enter your document id If there is no paper in printer you need to go to reception on another floor I was expecting bathrobe and slippers in such hotel Only 1 small tube of shower gel and shampoo for 2 people is just not enough People on reception may be a little more pleasant except the guy who did check in for us he was great </Bad>

		<Bad> Lighting in room was very poor shower in room needs looking at we didn t book at disabled room so why the shower cant have a small lip step in order to stop the water running out is beyond me 19 euro s each for breakfast don t bother just head out to one of the many restaurants cafes around Lots of reviews mentioned noise from night club didn t really hear that much but the amount of young people hanging around outside the hotel until 3 4am is quite unnerving We came in late from a concert 1 30am and was surprised and a little intimidated by the groups Staff were ok efficient didn t encounter any of prior mentioned issues with rudeness or arrogant nature nor did we encounter a enthusiastic welcome or did you enjoy your stay departure all a little non plus You pay a 100 euro deposit on arrival which you are then told will be processed overnight on day of departure till no sign of this and no reply as yet to follow up email I have seen this mentioned before in reviews </Bad>

		<Bad> Waited half an hour upon arrival with noone to speak to as desk clerk was out for lunch Booking stated no charge except pre auth of 50 Pounds prior to arrival Full amount for the night was charged to the card prior to arrival desk clerk then tried to say this was the deposit and that he still had to charge me for the room we disagreed then after arguing infront of another delayed guest he agreed to complete the transaction for the night and hold only a 50 pound bond when i suggested the booking info be updated he said it was right clearly not The website and all booking com correspondence has said the funds will be released within 7 working days we are now onto the 14th working day since leaving and several emails to the hotel No response and the amount is still pending on my card Not trying to nitpick but very clearly misled on a number of fronts a real shame considering the room was very nice climate controlled and the bed extremely comfortable </Bad>

		<Bad> On the second day the breakfast staff appeared to be confused as to the breakfast I had paid for and was made to wait until they verified This took over 5 mins and I was embarrassed at having to wait at the desk in full view of other guests I chose to leave the desk as they still had not verified this was despite having breakfast the previous day I complained on checkout and was told sorry The pillows are too hard and full and no natural give in them They are not good quality and are synthetic </Bad>
		<Good> The reception staff were very friendly and very helpful The hotel is very clean and looks amazing Near to central London without being too close to the noise of the city 10 minutes walk to get to Oxford Street 5 mins from Tottenham Court Road station The rooms had everything needed hairdryer iron ironing board etc</Good>

		<Good> I love this Hotel Hotel Room Service The hotel itself is very cosy and comfy stayed in room 052 on the fifth floor and the room was beautiful and just like the pictures on the website comfy double bed Free WiFi size of the room was comfy specially in a city as Paris where rooms are tiny with a balcony just like I requested minibar espresso machine tea kettle with tea fresh complimentary water flat screen TV relaxing bathroom with all needed amenities Hotel was very quiet and relaxing at all times Room service was wonderful and kept my room super clean at all times Tried their laundry service and it was useful and they took care of my jeans despite me requesting for it late at night As I stayed there during Christmas I got a complementary bottle of Champagne on arrival I was given the choice between it and fruits of course I went with Champagne considering its Christmas in Paris as well as Chocolates on Christmas eve along with handwritten cards which I appreciated Staff absolutely wonderful staff special thanks to the wonderful ladies as well as Riza always willing to help English speaking very friendly professional and respectful always smiling they really were a pleasure to deal with and helped me many times Location great location right next to the Musee d Orsay few steps away from the RER the Louvre is around 5 7 mins walk away infact most touristic places are easily accessible from it wither by foot or RER Cabs can easily also reach it since its next to the muse d Orsay There are several restaurants and cafes and supermarket around it 2 3mins away so you have everything you need Breakfast I tried their breakfast twice and I enjoyed it yet keep in mind that the menu doesn t change Scrambled eggs sausage bacon croissants and bread Coffee Tea juices </Good>

		<Bad> So this was our second time staying at Sir Albert and I must say that we had a completely diferent experience This time by my own mistake I chose a smaller room than the last time and we noticed some diferences that really impacted in our opinion of the hotel The room was so small that we couldn t pull our MEDIUM SIZED suitcase past the entrance we had to carry it to the other side of the room and don t ask me how we walked around The cleaniness of the room was also really lacking the room didn t have the courtesy water skimping on water is just sad and other minor details Overall I think that this is still a good hotel but if you have a look around you can find better rooms in the same price range </Bad>
		<Good> Most of the staff is still quite nice and acomodating the view from the room was really pretty and the location of the hotel is really good walking distance to many tourist attractions nice restaurants and public transport </Good>

		<Bad> This place is outside the city and it takes a good 20 25 minutes to the Dam Square The hotel does not offer shuttle service to the airport or to the train station which was a disappointment One of the staff members showed an attitude but the others were very helpful There is a tram station close by and we used it a lot </Bad>

		<Bad> We were charged 7 50 for a small bottle of water from the minibar When we complained about the ridiculous charges especially as there was no complimentary water we were told that the water in Amsterdam is clean enough to drink from the tap Which of course we didn t know One of the lifts didn t work during our stay which meant that we had to wait for a lift 10 15 minutes each time we needed to use it There were no stairs for alternative </Bad>

		<Good> Friendly staff the rooms were spacious and had a relaxing atmosphere The location was not in the tourist city centre but close to the Metro tram meaning a peaceful evening and good access to attractions The nature themed panels and walls gave a calm ambience Overall very impressed with the hotel and will stay here again next time in Amsterdam </Good>

		<Bad> I handed in clothing at reception on time for them to be delivered for laundry I was told that I would get my clean clothing 24 hours later Over 24 hours later I called reception only to be told that there had been miscommunication between the morning shift staff and night staff and that my clothing had not been laundered During the 24 hour period no one called me to tell me to get my clothing I assume all staff saw the laundry bag lying there but did nothing about it This was sorely disappointing and an inconvenience to me The location is a bit out of town for its price </Bad>

		<Good> The hotel is really nice the lobby is comfortable with a fireplace in the middle and we enjoyed ourselves sipping wine and beer at night The room is clean and nice beds are comfortable The staff is young and friendly One of the best things is location the hotel is just a 5 minute walk from the train station Amsterdam Sloterdijk and one stop 5 min to the city center by train and two or three stops 12 min to the airport That is why everything was very accessible and convenient during our stay </Good>

		<Bad> The rooms are small and lack some maintenance You would not expect this in a 4 star hotel There were holes in the bathroom wall for fixation of the towel support in a previous position The shower was leaking in a corner and did not have a closing door so whenever we took a shower the whole floor was wet I told the manager and he said he will send someone to repair but he didn t The lamp in the room and it is not well fixed to the ceiling The room they propose as a family room is very small for 4 people I am sorry to write this because I liked the hotel overall and the position is perfect I would still recommend it </Bad>

		<Bad> The area outside the hotel seems to be a popular gathering point for socializing and partying If you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room </Bad>
		<Good> The location is a big asset since it s within easy walking distance of the wonderful cathedral and the quaint shops and outstanding restaurants in the old city It is not close to the beach but had a pleasant rooftop pool with lounge chairs and an exercise room The staff spoke good English and went out of their way to be helpful Getting taxis was easy The room we stayed in had the shower in a bathtub This is an issue for some people with leg issues Stepping in can be tricky Ask if this is an issue they might have rooms with handicapped access The full breakfast is rather pricey at 18 euros per person but it s huge and the quality is very good The menu included cooked selections which were excellent If you are a big breakfast eater it s a great option We would definitely stay there again </Good>

		<Bad> The batteries in the locker had run very low which made it very difficult to operate That wasn t fixed until days later The breakfast lounge kitchen was undermanned things would run out and it would take too long to wait for them to be replaced There were quite a number of cheap iron chairs there that needed fixing The rubber pad at the bottom had come off so there was this incredible screech every time you moved the chair or stood up The beds were uncomfortable too stiff I found it strange having to pay for all the hotel weeks in advance and that the payment would be nonrefundable </Bad>
		<Good> The staff were generally friendly and helpful both at the reception the breakfast lounge and the room maids </Good>

		<Bad> There was one member of staff who was quite unhelpful and came across a little rude however the other members of staff made up for it as they were really helpful and couldn t do enough for us </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel was very chic clean and comfortable and the staff were really helpful It was in easy access to the tube station which made it really easy to get around I would certainly stay there again and would highly recommend it to my friends </Good>

		<Bad> Restaurant needs updating refreshing Cost of the breakfast was too expensive and children should be free </Bad>
		<Good> The location was right next to Towrr Bridge tube station and within a few minutes walk of tower bridge the Tower of London and the river Piccadilly was about 12 in a cab away for New Year s Day parade but we were quite happy to stay local The first day we were ice skating in front of the Tower of London then went for a burger very close by are Zizzi and Gourmet Burger company What we also discovered was across the road at Keepers you can buy full breakfast including cooked breakfast for 16 per adult and children free whereas a continental breakfast at the hotel was 23 an adult and half that price for a child We didn t try the hotel breakfast however did have room service which was reasonably priced and tasty We didn t eat in any of the restaurants as I do t like sushi and the other restaurant looked so empty and dreary ISIS bar was friendly and nice to sit with a glass of wine The hotel itself was lively Spa and pool really nice Our room was huge which was a twin double and also a cot was provided Nothing was too much trouble and even when my pushchair inner tube had a hole in it the hotel leant me a pushchair for the duration of my stay 4 days 3 nights Apart from the cost of the breakfast and the restaurant looking so uninviting the hotel was brilliant Great location for three Tower of London Thames cruises and tower bridge Definitely reccomeneded Keepers across the road for breakfast and and evening meal and drink Room very clean and comfortable and we had a lovely stay for new year If you want the west end Piccadilly etc it s all accessible by the tube but we cabbed it everywhere as it was easier with 2 small children and also visited Hyde park winter wonderland which cost around 14 I also had a facial in the spa which was very nice and the pool was lovely Towels are provided for free but no robes if only swimming Changing area clean and tidy I would definitely stay again </Good>

		<Bad> i was not too impressed with cleanliness the bathroom sink was a little clogged and didn t look too clean I was also offered the choice between an inward looking and an outside looking room I was under the impression that there was an inner courtyard or garden so I opted for the inward room To my disappointment there was no view no greenery </Bad>
		<Good> location To be honest I wanted a place near my workshop and this was a short walking distance I didn t use the hotel facilities and just slept in the room so I can t say a lot </Good>

		<Good> The very central location of the property Spacious very friendly staff and all we met couldn t do more to help us feel very welcomed It was a wedding anniversary weekend and this was recognised by the team which was very considerate by a simple note and two lovely amazing pastries Breakfast was super as were all the staff from Kieran on reception to the folks in the restaurant The view we had overlooking Dam Square was brilliant </Good>

		<Bad> Location meant it was very hard to get in and out of the hotel at times as many groups waited outside for coach tours There was no view from the room as it viewed out to more building This meant not much natural light could get into the room The decor needed updating as it was very brown but as before a very nice room nonetheless </Bad>
		<Good> Staff were very friendly and the concierge could not have more helpful on the first day telling us which tram we would need and giving us a city map Room was set over two floors with stairs down the bed very nice Very large room and comfortable bed Location was perfect not too far for any attractions and opposite central station to pick up any trains trams and buses </Good>

		<Bad> 1 The always blocking locking keys we were staying for sometime and not for the first time and they re always a big problem they randomly stop working or allow You to enter places You shouldn t be in 2 Clarity and intentions of some of the staff could use an improvement This was the last trip of mine to Amsterdam without the magical card 3 I wish I parted ways in a more friendly manner with the management of the hotel</Bad>
		<Good> As always the meals were fantastic most if not all of the staff was very supportive they understood and listened to the customers that would be me needs I always recommend Jaz Amsterdam but would advice to plan in advance that way You get the best of the best worlds Also if You plan on seeing the City it s good to take more nights as it s not mentioned but longer stays give You reductions and que free experiance of stuff like Adam Lookout or Madam Tussauds </Good>

		<Good> We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it The hotel has got a modern design the room and bathroom were clean the bed very comfortable and you can use a coffee machine for free tea and water are also available The breakfast offers a lot of different cold meat cheese jam various sorts of bread eggs fruit cereals and yoghurt You get freshly pressed orange juice tea water and tasty coffee Cappuccino Caf Latte On sunday morning there was live jazz music in the dining room In the evening you can listen to live music as well and enjoy a beer or long drink in the hotel bar The hotel is well situated you need only 5 minutes by foot to the next train and metro station Bijlmer ArenA It takes 10 15 minutes by metro to the city centre of Amsterdam I really recommend a stay at Jaz Amsterdam </Good>

		<Bad> The hotel does not serve alcoholic drinks It wasn t too much of a problem for us as we spent a lot of time in the central area but would have been nice to have a quiet drink in the evenings </Bad>
		<Good> The room was a good sized as well the bathroom with underfloor heating Coffee machine was a fab addition to the room The location was perfect with a tram stop right outside the hotel to get to central station There is also a Lidl near by for any shopping needs </Good>

		<Bad> Two things I didn t like although minor issues 1 That a hotel representative tries to charge you in your own currency instead of the local currency in some desperate search for profits through an extremely bad exchange rate for the customer 2 That a hotel informs you that they have a special arrangement with a taxi company with a fixed rate of 35 EUR and that the taxi driver charges 46 EUR while the taxi that brought us from the airport to the hotel the night before charged 28 EUR </Bad>
		<Good> We do like Amsterdam and spent a very nice morning there in the Rijksmuseum area in a transfer to another destination </Good>

		<Bad> The water dripping constantly outside the entrance to Room 1007 Not related to the hotel but when we called for an early morning pick up to Victoria Green line Coach station to catch a tour to Cotswolds on 14th May 2017 the driver didn t know the location neither did he have a GPS tracker with him He fished out a physical map and magnifying glass to locate it Ultimately reached our destination only because we had our GPS on Almost missed our expensive prepaid tour </Bad>
		<Good> Good breakfast Liked the Cumberland sausages a lot The Fish and chips we had at the restaurant bar for dinner over two nights was extremely delicious The grilled salmon with noodles a second best Convenient location to catch buses to Wembley Central or Wembley Park station and Brent cross Convenience of summoning cab service from hotel foyer dedicated phone </Good>

		<Bad> The team lacked focus on service I asked for an iron and ironing board would have expected these items to be in a room anyway I was told I couldn t have it overnight and would need to call in the morning embarrassing having to open your door wearing PJ s at 7am No tea or coffee making facilities in the room you could purchase tea and coffee if required There was a house being renovated next door constant banging and drilling we wanted to rest for an hour before heading out again that was impossible The room was very small there was a wet patch on the carpet from the radiator general maintenance was poor Would definitely not go back to this hotel it is no where near worth the money we paid I would have been hugely disappointed had I paid the going rate 750 pound for two nights it wasn t worth the 355 we paid Stayed in a holiday inn express for our third night it was by far the most superior of the two at 60 pound for the night Obviously Durrant hotel have an abundance of regular unsuspecting travellers therefore not expecting this feedback to be worth much to them hope it s worth it to the unsuspecting travellers of the future </Bad>

		<Bad> While the staff was very friendly receptive to questions and requests for help they made reservations for Guell Park and Familia Sagrada for which we were appreciative However the company with whom they deal was not known or listed with the park and we had to wait at least ten minutes for the tickets to be recognized For the cathedral a different staff member did not tell us that this agency doesn t offer the opportunity for an audioguide or guide and we couldn t access the second level closed to those with no specialized ticket This was extremely frustrating and disappointing Otherwise they were sensitive to our needs Our room was comfortable the cleaning staff very flexible and thorough We had a terrace which faced a another building so no real view Members of our family spent time on the rooftop where a pool is situated and the bar on the ground level It s a clean hotel and located in a great neighborhood We recommend a stay An aside there was a taxi strike countrywide so we had to take the metro to the train session pulling 2 suitcases each up and down stairs Many people helped us out however on the escalator to the train station two young men who in retrospect were likely watching us helped us with our luggage While doing so they opened my purse and stole my new wallet which contained many euros and dollars thus they made a haul I wouldn t have been aware except a man yelled that I d been robbed Unfortunately our timing was such that I couldn t report it to the police at the entrance of the line for train travel which was also frustrating and discouraging Luckily my passport was in a zippered pouch as I had and have no other identification necessitating much hassle back home needing to reapply and replace much needed information </Bad>

		<Bad> The only downside to our trip was the service on the rooftop bar and restaurant We were mostly ignored when we were up there and the service was horrendously slow and sometimes did not come at all We were even refused entry on one night when we went up or a drink because they were too busy Not good enough in my opinion it was like they were not part of the same hotel Rude and obnoxious We did report this to the hotel when we checked out The rooftop area is beautiful and one of the main attractions for this hotel Peace and tranquility in a city is a rare touch its just a shame the staff that worked up there let it down </Bad>
		<Good> Staff were excellent room was beautiful and the hotel is in a great location everything in walking distance The facilities in the hotel were very good Would definitely stay here again and did not want to leave </Good>

		<Bad> There was water in the room but it did not have a price so we thought it was no charge as some nice properties offer complimentary water if there is no price I am looking into this to see if this was an error or an accidental charge for something else The barista guy working coffee shop was unfriendly curt and not professional I was taken aback a little by this since the property is so nice and everybody else was so nice He was an angry hipster which has no place in the hospitality industry or a brand like this hotel </Bad>
		<Good> I loved the offering of restaurants lounge and rooftop choices There were little surprises throughout the property The room was well designed and mindful for the guest and I really enjoyed it </Good>

		<Bad> would have like to have seen the rooftop terrace Not quite ready yet but sure it will be open before long </Bad>
		<Good> Great room very quiet we had taken an inner room Very comfy beds powerful shower Great after a hard day sightseeing High standards of cleaning daily in our room Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful Special mention to Daniel for his helpful advice on places to eat and info on surrounding area Easy check in out Well thought through design and appreciated being in an individually designed hotel that exceeds the photos information on the booking site Staff polite well trained and all seem to be happy in their jobs very good at making their guests welcome and important Enjoyed our very good coffee coissants in Satans every morning Enjoyed a drink in Libertine each night before going out Didn t eat in restaurants so cannot comment however sure they would not disappoint Lovely ambiance busy vibe later in evening when DJ playing very busy we didn t stay as was just heading up to bed Good location 2 mins to nearest metro although we walked to most of the places we wanted to go Barcelona is a cosmopolitan vibrant city that we hope to revisit soon We for sure will be returning to Casa Bonay would highly recommend to anyone coming to Barcelona who wants to stay somewhere interesting different to the other hotels on offer </Good>

		<Good> This is a location you might think of for your sejour in Vienna There is a tram 5 mins of walking that will take you right in the heart of the city at the Wien Opera The rooms are very clean spacious and they got modern furniture The breakfast was really tasty of course could be more various but after all it will do its job the blue cheese was awesome So if you want not to spend to much money on expensive hotels in the centre of town you will definitely want to consider this as a perfect location </Good>

		<Bad> Minor details but there was a bag of peanuts and biscuits on the tray which appeared to be complimentary but weren t We didn t touch the minibar but were still still charged excessively for a bag of peanuts The room was at the front and was a tad noisy as we had to have the windows open as so hot July Shut was much quieter Would recommend requesting a room other than the front if visiting in the summer </Bad>
		<Good> Breakfast was superb with plenty of choice Location perfect Although not necessary the towels and bed linen were changed daily Secure bag storage on checking out Staff very friendly and helpful Character property with a lovely cool courtyard at the rear </Good>

		<Good> Fabulous Great location beautiful hotel and extremely helpful and genuinely friendly staff Amazing value for money The concierge showed me to my room and offered me a cup or tea which was brought up instantly and not added to my bill and they waived the two bottles of water I took from the mini bar Really nice and thoughtful touches </Good>

		<Good> The bed was so comfy as were the pillows The facilities in the room were excellent lovely bathroom with separate bath shower Clean towels everyday We paid to include breakfast in our stay and it was certainly value for money so much to choose from and set us up for the day The hotel was only 15 minutes from the city centre by tram tram 1 or 17 and you can can purchase a tram card from the hotel which was value for money It was a 5 minute walk to catch the tram from the hotel All the staff from the receptionist to housekeepers were lovely and helpful nothing was to much trouble for them One of the best hotels I ve stayed in and would definitely stay there again </Good>

		<Good> The rooms were beautifully appointed and clean and the flowers that were provided stayed fresh the entire week we were there The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed each meal We enjoyed having a drink or cappuccino in the Library every evening and talking to each of the bartenders each one was so personable and attentive My friend had misplaced her sweater and by chance asked if anyone had turned it in to the front desk and the next morning the sweater was returned to her She thought she d lost it in on a visit to Den Haag I would highly recommend the Ambassaade for a carefree destination in Amsterdam </Good>

		<Good> A great experience The room service was fantastic and the bed and pillows were so comfortable The hotel offers complimentary drinks and snacks every afternoon and the full breakfast is included in the price The staff went out of their way to assist us in planning our outings every day Only one small glitch the television had a mind of it s own The staff did send a repairman the next morning This is a charming older hotel with character and personality Not your run of the mill chain hotel with hundreds of rooms We would definitely return again we were in Room 206 it had a great canal view and street view as it was a corner room So be sure to ask for 206 or 306 or 406 for a lovely large comfortable room </Good>

		<Bad> The bathroom was a little on the small side but otherwise very clean and functional </Bad>
		<Good> Arriving after a long haul flight from Australia I found the check in staff most helpful I chose to stay at this hotel because my friend and I were joining a Trafalgar Tour which left from there We found it easy to get around London public transport was very close The Hotel itself was very clean and welcoming After a long day tripping around London it was really nice to sit in the bar downstairs before dinner and enjoy the ambiance </Good>

		<Bad> Its not the cheapest hotel in the area and while it is very clean and modern I felt that there wasnt any added value for the relatively high price the rooms while clean are basic why not add a coffee machine The breakfast is very expensive 20 euros per person and not included in the rooms price which forced us to eat outside every morning Thankfully there are a couple of very nice cafes right in front of the hotel The shower water pressure was also not great at all </Bad>
		<Good> The hotel is super clean being pretty new it looks very modern and thoughtfully designed The rooms were kept in pristine condition every day The location is very close to the central station The staff was very kind and welcoming </Good>

		<Bad> Couldn t really fault anything we were there for 2 days and had to ask for extra tea and coffee as think the cleaners forgot the second night but staff at reception gave us some straight away without waiting Really couldn t fault anything such a good hotel </Bad>
		<Good> Hotel was amazing and staff were really helpful and friendly Location was really good as well only around a 10 minute walk to the tram station and then an extra 20 minutes on the tram into the centre 10 if you go to Rijksmuseum and walk from there which is what we did we didn t have any food at the hotel but menu looked pretty good a bit pricey for us but nice if you want a treat Would definitely recommend this hotel </Good>

		<Bad> 1GB data cap per room is nothing in 2016 Compared to other hotels staff we have visited during our trip I felt the least welcome here </Bad>
		<Good> The location was good but next time I will be ok to live further away if I can get a better hotel The central Vienna is very small compared to big cities and walkable </Good>

		<Good> Nice and modern hotel with friendly and polite service Pretty interiors have everything you need during stay I reccomend to check the library in coffee bar and a lovely balcony at last floor where you can rest The location isn t the best if you are first time in town not too close to all attractions But the area is calm with nice buildings around and close to the beach big shopping centre and museum blau There is also a metro station nearby L4 The price was also really attractive comparing to other hotels </Good>

		<Bad> Well I choose this venue as it was a 70th Birthday Present for my friend as her son had bought tickets to see Neal Diamond And to be honest seeing the venue on line and the comments thought this would be perfect for her Was not impressed when arriving there was an issue regards payment on booking Then when we entered the room very disappointed Two holes in one of lamps bathroom had mildew on the tiles and surroundings on the floor the bin in the bathroom had no liner and was dirty inside the window facing one of the beds would not shut so all we heard was a generator all night as this was broke on the advice of a Duty Manager coming to look but as it was Sunday no maintenance to fix The air vent in bathroom was broken the valance on my bed was stained at the bottom I have taken photo s regards the issues with the room Then when leaving was told had to pay for disability parking which was not explained on arrival The receptionist asked for our car registration but we thought this was just checking what cars go with guests We were not told this was for payment Cannot blame receptionist as apparently she was new and still training but no one with her to supervise Kind Regards Patricia Finan</Bad>

		<Bad> What was strange The receptionist gave me a bill that contained the cost of accomodation minus fee paid to the booking com Which is strange The invoice should be inclusive and a client shouldn t care about the structure of the cost of accomodation </Bad>
		<Good> Location is good The cost of accomodation was pleasing to my eyes The room was spacious and nice All in all the very decent hotel </Good>

		<Bad> There is no lock for the bathroom door a little bit lack of privacy </Bad>
		<Good> It was a nice stay in this hotel Although the hotel is not located near the Vienna s Ringstrasse it has a very easy access to the public transport nearby Metro U3 can take you to from city centre tram 18 can take you to from the Wien Hauptbahnhof and bus 77A can take you to from Stadion for coaches directly And there are lots of large supermarket near the hotel which is convenient for us though they usually close at 8pm </Good>

		<Bad> Not so kind staff but maybe they were too much under pressure Little tricky to reach the hotel by car because you need to enter Area C which has controlled traffic so beware that the hotel has no private garage you can park in one that they indicate anyway it will cost you 35 40 per day but we already knew it thanks to others guests reviews and you need to buy a card in a Newspaper Shop to allow your car s plate to ride in Area C otherwise you ll get a fine But I just discovered that because I asked the staff I ve travelled throughout Firenze that works on the same system as well the guy then told me that we needed to do all that If I hadn t have asked him he wouldn t have told me but he knew I was by car See what I m trying to say is that the staff need to care more for the tourists in this kind of thing </Bad>
		<Good> Great location and breakfast was amazing Room was super comfy with a large bed Shower was good but we thought it cold be a little better for a 4 star hotel </Good>

		<Bad> I requested separatable twin beds since my brother and I were traveling together we got a non separating arrangement awkward I requested e z access to room because I had a knee injury we had many stairs at the furthest point from the elevators asked for e z access shower got only high tub impossible for me to use Our view was a white brick wall Carpet was not clean If I had been informed earlier they could not comply with our needs I would have gone elsewhere I was not given that courtesy which came off as deceptive </Bad>
		<Good> Breakfast had good variety but many fruit flies around the pastries Restaurant food was good but very pricey Location was great for canal boat trips Staff were very cordial and helpful Beautiful fountain adjacent to outdoor restaurant </Good>

		<Good> Fantastic location We were given a room with a view of the canal and it was lovely A voucher for 2 drinks at the bar and a small bottle of Prosecco to celebrate out wedding anniversary was a nice touch Very big comfy bed Only criticism is there is no mirror in the room only the bathroom The full length mirror is by the front door where it is dark </Good>

		<Bad> Linen was damaged there was a hole on a sheet I was surprised that during regular cleaning nobody changed it We didn t have possibility to eat in restaurant because it was busy by groups Even if you want to order soft drink you have to search staff by yourself and ask about attention to you We ordered pizza in room service it was not cut on pieces and staff didn t put even cutlery to do it by ourself Those issues are not so critical but annoying Pizza was good by the way </Bad>

		<Bad> Notwithstanding that the bathroom is well equipped including Mandeville bath slippers the only minus is the bathroom for two people it has too little space to put toiletries </Bad>
		<Good> In the years we visit London we stayed a couple of times in The Mandeville hotel located in Marylebone With a bunch restaurants around this hotel is within a 5 minute walk of Selfridges and 10 minutes walk to Bond Street Although the location is perfect we booked frequently another hotels The reason was that we got in the past very small rooms we hardly couldn t move in our room one step of everything This time it seemed as the rooms were renovated the rooms are colorfully decorated and we even had a Nespresso coffee machine in our room what gives this hotel as well more allure We had a really pleasant stay and what helps the staff is friendly and helpful </Good>

		<Bad> The view from our room wasn t great as there is a lot of construction going on outside the hotel The hotel is very out of the city however a tram stops right outside the hotel so this wasn t really an issue </Bad>
		<Good> The room was a fantastic size with extremely comfy beds and a fantastic en suite bathroom Tea and coffee was available in the room and the TV had familiar channels The breakfast and dinner buffet was really good and good value for money </Good>

		<Bad> I liked everything about this hotel so the only set back is the price we got a huge discount but with the regular price we would probably never decided to stay there and we would never know how great this hotel is </Bad>
		<Good> This hotel is great located in an interesting area of up and coming district of former ship yard You have to take a free ferry to the Central station but it only takes 10 minutes and actually is an atraction itself The room was really nice with great view of the city The staff at the reception was great very helpful especially Melissa went out of her way to make us feel at home At the best part they keep warm chocolate cookies at the reception and You can help yourself whenever You want </Good>

		<Bad> Expensive but I guess due to location it was ok but the price did not include breakfast which would have made the room price overly expensive There are better priced central places to stay but for a cruise this was a better choice pricewise than the Movenpick </Bad>
		<Good> We chose this hotel due to the closeness to the terminal for a cruise It was an easy 10 minute walk with the suitcases to board our cruise ship Also we had rented a car from Sixt and their office is right beside the hotel lobby so made it easy to collect and drop off car </Good>

		<Bad> Both my wife and I came off a River Cruise with chest infections The hotel allowed us an early check in however on entering our room we found that instead of the City or garden view promised in the Booking Com information we found our view consisted if 12 railway lines with nearly 100 trains a day passing our 5th floor room As we were both sick we could not be bothered asking to shift and to their credit after I complained about the room the hotel credited our dinner we had on the first night Not real value however at 200 euros plus per night Just a warning don t get room 590 unless you are a train buff </Bad>

		<Bad> Entrance to the hotel was hard to fondness but it wasn t fun The building it self has a lot fe activities but nobody told me about them until I checked out It could have been better if the staff presented while checking in Aesthetics were taken into consideration over function in general like there is no hangers near the shower </Bad>
		<Good> Although the service is slow the food would erase that thought totally The ambiance isn t a typical 4 star hotel and the quality is even better than most 5 stars hotels Everybody understands and speak English very well location is perfect Next to the ferry free where the central bus train subway station Amazing view to Amsterdam a and the River Sound proof guest rooms Nice elevator which will get you to your floor in no time You don t need to bring everything with you as the room Ian equipped with music player guitar rob you can buy anything you like in your bedroom the bed is extremely comfy super clean I m over sensitive about hygiene food is a must try </Good>

		<Bad> Reception staff On arrival I was effectively ordered to wait whilst the surly staff member did something terribly important on his computer for fully five minutes Finally I was checked in by a second employee who had been chatting the whole time with another person However I m STILL waiting to be welcomed to the hotel During my five day stay only one staff member offered friendly greetings as I came and went It seems most of the others especially Mr Surly don t know the value of a customer Sound proofing in rooms is excellent in blocking out street noise but between rooms adjacent and above footfalls cupboard doors and water noises were disturbing </Bad>
		<Good> Location was perfect of course The room was well spacious and well appointed housekeeping staff were excellent and the rooftop bar was extremely pleasant We enjoyed a beautiful pizza with drinks and found the staff up there to be quite delightful full of smiles and very friendly The hotel has modern attractive decor and is pleasantly light </Good>

		<Bad> The nearest metro exit is about a ten minute walk Didn t really mind it too much though If you re lazy and don t like walking or carrying a lot of luggage this might be an issue We took a cab from and to the airport anticipating this though so we didn t struggle at all </Bad>
		<Good> Located far enough away from las rambles and Barceloneta beach to be quiet at night but close enough to get everywhere very easily by bike or metro We rented bikes from the hotel one day very basic bikes but get the job done I m not picky and rode to Barceloneta beach and loved it Relaxed had lunch relaxed more rode around had dinner and then rode the 15min ride back to the hotel We got everywhere else by metro Their was also a calmer beach right in front of the hotel </Good>

		<Bad> Nothing it was perfect </Bad>
		<Good> We loved everything about the Claris from the complimentary upgrade to a fab suite to the welcoming glass of champagne and then the lovely bottle of wine in our room The room was so comfortable and clean the products in the bathroom were amazing Every member of the staff were friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs and nothing was any bother Even when we went across the road for a coffee while waiting for our airport transfer the doorman came over himself to let us know it had arrived and not to worry he would load our cases and call us when it was time to go While it was too early in the year for sunbathing the roof top terrace is really lovely and affords great views of the city We will definitely be back and would recommend the Claris to anyone travelling to Barcelona </Good>

		<Bad> My boyfriend and I went to the spa at various times throughout the day and each and every time there was a sign there that said Please do not disturb Doing a massage in the back But the sign literally never moved I m convinced only one person was on shift both days or something because whomever was never at the desk I also had trouble with room service To order pizza and it took an hour of our request for an hour to be fulfilled So getting things done in a timely fashion when it comes to room service wasn t the best </Bad>
		<Good> The location of the hotel is great It is very close to Las Ramblas about 5 mins walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants and shops around The bed was a nice size big and comfortable The shower is bigger than my walk in closet I m not even joking The staff at at reception were all very enthusiastic and helpful They have someone posted at the entrance at all times to call a taxi for hotel guest They halted a taxi for us at 3 a m so we could catch our early morning flight I also enjoyed the bar and lounge areas All very nice </Good>

		<Bad> The breakfast is atrocious on several levels It is really a shame that an otherwise nice hotel has such a poor quality breakfast room which small and cramped and in the basement so has no natural light The quality of the food was dismal The hot food was cold and when they tried to reheat it the reconstituted scrambled eggs became greenish grey and clumped together just awful Adding freshly cooked eggs costs 6 7 euros extra PER EGG when most hotels provide omelette bars and fresh eggs as part of the breakfast When we arrived for breakfast it was just after 9AM and many items were already gone We were so disappointed after the first day we found our breakfasts outside the hotel even though we had prepaid at the hotel and were not expecting a refund Also the location near the main station is not so salubrious and its a bit scary around there at night time </Bad>
		<Good> The room and the bed were excellent even if the view was nothing special The lobby and bar were very nice as well Overall the hotel is very high quality Now if only you could say the same about the breakfast </Good>

		<Bad> Not ideal for people visiting Milan not in the center You can easily get the metro in though Decor very outdated Area is dead late at night </Bad>
		<Good> Across from the train station so if you are using it for a short layover ideal location Rooms are large for Italy Breakfast was plentiful and staff friendly </Good>

		<Bad> Bathroom floor was not clean It was difficult to communicate with some of the staff ok they were not really client facing staff but you still may need to ask things from them as they did not speak any English It is a bit far from the old town you may not see it from maps when booking but they are on a fairly steep hill </Bad>
		<Good> Luxury just as a five star hotel should be We loved the outside pool the friendly staff there the views from the hotel and that we received a lot of attention whatever our request was </Good>

		<Bad> The noise was unbelievable Doors walls and floors were far from soundproof We could hear everyone down the corridor the surrounding rooms and the rooms above and below That was a big disappointment The bar at the hotel is a joke and though this hotel chain is famous for their design this time it was just inconvenient than anything else You needed extra effort to close the bathroom door the lightning was very poor and the closet was good only if you were carrying a t shirt and a pair of socks </Bad>
		<Good> Location was very convenient as its just above the metro and train station The surrounding area not that great though </Good>

		<Good> The best cosy room I have ever stayed in I have never come across a bathroom so well stocked with everything you could think of and all the toiletries in full size bottles Cowshed so no skimping Also thank you for putting ceiling lights in the bedroom so many rooms these days only have wall lights I had dinner with my nieces in Millies restaurant and it was excellent my only Moan is I could not get into the roof top restaurant even though I was a resident It would be helpful if you could book in advance Other than that excellent hotel and would definitely recommend it</Good>

		<Bad> The breakfast was insanely expensive I thought it was included when I booked and the windows don t keep any of the sound from the streets out My window faced an Irish pub so it was pretty noisy most of the night </Bad>

		<Bad> Poor value for money Bath is old fashioned the shower was leaking all the time out of the bath tub I fixed it myself but kept leaking Booked a comfort double room and asked for a room with a good view a month in advance I was told I should have paid more to guarantee a canal view one so I decided to not going fo it but ended up in a small double with an awful view something like and internal courtyard I paid around 400 euro for two nights and unfortunately they were not worth it for having a room like that Only 2 small shower towels are provided and 2 face ones if I haven t visited other hotels of the same range price in other countries this last month I would have probably rated the hotel better but i think it s too expensive for what it has been offered Friendly staff at least </Bad>

		<Bad> The bed was too comfortable an made it difficult to get up in the morning </Bad>
		<Good> The staff were fantastically helpful and welcoming The hotel is located perfectly being just a 2 minute walk from the train station 7 for 2 people to the airport instead of 50 70 in a taxi and right next to metro line 5 which takes you into the heart of Amsterdam The room itself was clean and welcoming The personalization on the IPad room control and the TV was also a nice touch In short one of the best places I have ever stayed in </Good>

		<Bad> The location of the hotel seems best suited for business travelers who have affairs meetings at the nearby conference center or office buildings Otherwise the neighborhood is a bit off the usual tourist pathways It s not hard to catch a tram to get to the museums or touristy areas of town but it s not the best choice for tourists who want a home base that is closer to the center of town where the most popular sights of Amsterdam are </Bad>
		<Good> Friendly service and cozy room full of thoughtful and playful details It was kind of mind blowing to have a room with tube like glass chambers for the toilet and shower it was a clever unusual detail that made a tiny room seem much bigger I also liked the big drawer under the bed easy to store clothes and various souvenir buys there Having a small desk nearby to do work was very handy too The bed was super comfy and the room was quiet a welcome oasis after a 9 hour flight from India Very cool to have options for mood lighting and music controlled by the ipad near the bedstand Breakfast and the downstairs cantina bar was excellent all you can eat scrambled eggs and roasted tomatoes bacon bread or granola and yogurt Worth ordering ahead of time since they charge more if you just get it on the day of The open fridge with beers sodas and snacks was also a cut above and very convenient especially since it seemed like the next closest convenience store was at the Amsterdam Zuid station about a 10 minute walk away The bar and the living room area was great for socializing and relaxing I felt 20 hipper by staying at Citizen M The hotel is conveniently located near the Amsterdam Zuid train and metro stations it s a quick one stop ride from the airport It was also a good home base when I did a day trip to s Hertogenbosch The staff kindly took good care of my suitcases while i was off on my day trip and provided excellent friendly service every step of the way </Good>

		<Bad> The location is quiet far from the last metro station and there are no taxis to travel to hotel Especially in the dark its very scary Either provide some sort of shuttle service between the hotel and the metro station Even calling a taxi from hotel was hard because the distance is too less to the metro station and we have to travel to the next metro station Honestly this makes the stay itself pretty poor irrespective of how the hotel is </Bad>

		<Bad> The hotel does its best with the resources it has however an elevator from the parking garage to the main floor would be helpful for people with baby strollers or disabilities There is an elevator in the building that goes up from the main floor however to get to it one still needs to get up a small set of stairs </Bad>
		<Good> A very cozy great atmosphere hotel not far from Vienna s center Located on a quiet street Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber invites with its feels like home decor with old late 19th early 20th century chests and wardrobes board games and books for guests perusal and a restaurant that literally used to be someone s dining room a long time ago The room was spacious and well kept The hotel also has an underground garage which was very helpful for us in the winter Breakfast buffet was very good albeit simple The food quality is high Staff is very friendly and helpful </Good>

		<Bad> The hotel seems like it s very modern and new but the hotel is renewed and it s really old also it s so hidden and you should take care in the night when you go out and come back because it s in a hidden area The hotel its self is so busy this is because it has over hundreds of rooms and you can find only 2 3 people in the reception for check in and check out therefore you need more than 15 20 min to do that However the hotel lobby changed to a night club after 9 pm and there s a DJ mixer plays music which was so noisy to me especially when people got drunk and you ve children and you don t want them to see how they look like In addition i was given a room you need 5 7 min walk to reach it I walk through 3 4 corridors to get into my room Finally for me i don t recommend this hotel at all and i won t come again </Bad>

		<Good> The property was in a excellent central location for all the tourist sights and the staff were extremely helpful I would definately stay at Le Meridien again if I was to re visit Vienna</Good>

		<Bad> We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in mid August If it was for the first night my classification would be very low because they gave us a room with a queen size bed and we had an email confirmation for a king size bed and one of the front desk attendants could not manage with the problem in a professional way Moreover we found that the room was not properly cleaned But in the end they solved the problem in a perfect way which shows they really care about their clients </Bad>
		<Good> Very comfortable and well designed room with all necessary amenities Really soundproofed we could year no noise from other rooms Perfectly located near Passeig de Gr cia 30 meters from Diagonal metro station </Good>

		<Bad> The service was sloppy Definitely not a 4 star In my opinion it s barely a 3 star On arrival my partner and I were expected to take our own 5large suitcases to our room ourself No porter service was offered I requested house keeping to bring cotton buds on numerous occasions needless to say I am still waiting And the overall service of house keeping was not acceptable We left a carrier bag of trash next to the full bin And it was left there for two days They literally made the bed and brought towels They didn t replenish the teabags or cotton pads Nor did they bring them on request The most disappointing experience was breakfast where I found a piece of bright blue plastic in my omelette The dish was taken away but no apology was made The waiter just brought a new omelette without communcating with us and more importantly without an apology </Bad>
		<Good> The only thing that was like able about the stay was the location of the hotel </Good>

		<Bad> The pool itself is very small and is really an exercise pool and was spoilt by use of young unruly children in the evening with extremely discourteous parents Some elderly guests were observed to come to the pool but then leave due to this unruly behaviour of others </Bad>
		<Good> Our second stay at this hotel which should have been enjoyable as first but was spoilt by being offered a paid upgrade room that was not at all clean as would be expected of 5 hotel The alternative better room offered had a broken tv The rooms themselves and beds in particular were very comfortable and superb breakfast that on Saturday continues to 2pm the location of the hotel is good for walking to the old town area Staff were helpful </Good>

		<Bad> Totally overrated If true that decoration wise the hotel is simply beautiful it is not understandable that in my room believe there are bigger rooms besides not existing a closet we had in total 4 hangers For long stays forget it Hotel despite a great rooftop restaurant does not offer room service breakfast in room No desk or some sort of place in the room where to leave your suitcase you d better have only one piece of luggage or even put your laptop if you need to work a bit </Bad>

		<Bad> The bedrooms need a bit of renovation It was hard to open the door with the heavy brass key you turn right three times to open it The lift would not respond immediately The wifi was not fast I found this difficult whenever I needed to contact my family back in the PH </Bad>
		<Good> The FEMALE receptionist was lovely Coming from a train from Salzburg she I forgot her name greeted us with a cheerful attitude The closet in our room had a lot of useful compartments This hotel is near Stephanplatz When you turn left on the street the hotel is located you will be shocked to immediately see Stephan s Church you can climb the narrow tower but it will be quite a journey more than 300 steps 4 euros for an adult The Spanish Riding School is less than 10 minutes by foot from there you can walk straight to the Museum Quarter less than 10 minutes also You will see designer stores in this area Bring a water bottle with you because there are several TRINKWASSER booths were you can refill them You can take the bus or the tram something I personally did not do because I find bus routes to be very confusing I HIGHLY suggest the HOP ON HOP OFF bus Take a 24 hour ticket for all the lines 25 euros per adult and it will BE WORTH IT The easiest one to find is in the Museum Quarter The yellow line takes you to Schonbrunn Palace Belvedere where DUR KUSS or THE KISS is located This is difficult to go to by yourself so take the HOP ON HOP OFF Book a tour with ROYAL TOURS 119 euros per adult TOTALLY WORTH IT It s a small bus it can fit about 8 people with one man as the driver and guide IT IS GREAT I suggest Prague over Budapest We did not take the Salzburg a beautiful place so take the tour if you were not ale to stay the night because we just came from there </Good>

		<Good> The staff was very nice helpful and friendly They also understood some trouble we had and were very eager to help The room was also neatly organized and made us feel really good </Good>

		<Bad> As I traveled with my mother of 50 I feel obliged to include her opinion as well She was disappointed in the toilet paper I kid you not and that no toiletries were provided Breakfast was good but could have been better in some aspects for example the Br tchen rolls buns were horrible All in all she expected a little more from a four star hotel I guess What we both noticed was that the cleaning staff was out very early every morning They were very talkative which really is not great with the doors being so badly soundproofed The same goes for some of the other hotel guests but you cannot blame the hotel for this </Bad>
		<Good> The staff is very friendly and helpful the bed was extra comfy and the bathroom was new and always clean Location is fantastic just across the street from a tube station but no traffic noise even with open windows And only a short ride into town Check out is until 12 am which is very convenient Breakfast is included and covers different sorts of bread also crossaints and Aufschnitt cold meat cream cheese some veggies a small selection of cereal sausages and eggs a fruit mix and yoghurt I do not remember whether there was any jam I f 25 was pretty content with everything my mother duh 50 only had some minor issues </Good>

		<Bad> The room was not as advertised no bathtub and so small we could barely walk And 1 chair which means 1 person would have to sit on bed When we complained we were given a bigger room However the towel rack did not work I called the front desk but noone ever fixed it during our 4 night stay </Bad>

		<Bad> The bed is uncomfortable It s old and very hard it should be replaced The ventilation is very noisy we had to turn it off during the night Cleaning could be better A comment about the breakfast service the staff works hard but I see a lack of organization The hotel was full during our stay and clearly the breakfast room wasn t large enough We had to wait in line to have a table There is only one island with water and juices and a full tank was emptied in less than 10 minutes There was a continuos shortage of stock of dishes and glasses The servers were running at full speed all the time and in all directions I feel like they were seriously understaffed Everyone had to do everything exemple the person at the reception had to leave a couple of times to serve coffee while people was waiting in line I understand the unusual peak of customers during Easter days but it looked like the management left the usual staff cover all the overcharge This is poor management IMHO they had to enforce the team and the facilities during these days I ve felt bad for the staff they were working way over their capacity The situation was chaotic </Bad>
		<Good> This is a business hotel with large room and good breakfast The staff is kind and helpful Located 5 minutes walk from Canary Wharf underground and DLR trains </Good>

		<Bad> Be careful with your expectations of the sleeping arrangements here I thought we had booked a room with double bed but arrived to find they only had a twin available for us When I queried this I was told that NH hotels only guarantee a room for two people when you book and that rooms with double beds are dependent on availability Not good when you have booked four weeks ahead and specified what you want I felt I wouldn t use an NH hotel again for this reason </Bad>

		<Bad> The shuttle bus issue we had Although a great service of free shuttle from airport being able to reserve a slot on production of your passport would be something you should think about as people that just exited the airport jumped on bus while we were putting our bags on as we were already first there waiting and then we had to remove our bags and shared a taxi with other people rather than wait another 40 mins for the shuttle to return </Bad>
		<Good> The friendliness of the staff comfy beds great city view from our room nice bathroom with great shower Wonderful bar on floor 17 with a rooftop area above I m sure I m the summer months this is a great place to spend time as temperatures were very low these days we stayed The immediate resolvement of the 2 issue we had We needed kettle replacing as the one in room was bit rusty inside replaced immediately although prob shouldn t have been in the room in first place house keeping issue there and gave us complimentary coffees from reception while waiting for kettle to be brought to room Also needed someone to come show us how to work the heater in room Called reception and nice guy came immediately and showed us The free shuttle from airport to hotel also super bonus and the 5 charge for return is good Great savings as would be much more expensive to organise transport </Good>

		<Good> I booked the room of this hotel from Booking com and stayed here for 2 days during our trip in London The location is so awesome that the majority of attractions could be reached within 20 mins by tube or even by walk The stuff of this hotel is professional as well especially a waiter Rico who is not only approachable polite and assist us a lot during our stays When it comes to the room the one we stayed was so clean spacious and comfortable that it is hard to believe this hotel has already opened for 150 years To sum up this is a hotel that we would like to visit again in the future </Good>

		<Good> the location was perfect Most of the staff was extremely helpful except for one lady who was extremely nastyon check in There was a big fair going on and they were obviously busy They even found a place for me to get my nails done However they also ruined a pair of my pants and said they were already ruined No way I could have had bleach on my pants So not happy with that Room was in the back and quiet and able to open windows However the room was dark Next time I may opt for a room in the front on a high floor but imagine the noise is pretty bad considering it faces a busy street </Good>

		<Bad> We booked a room with 2 single beds but upon arrival received 1 double bed When we asked for another room they said that nothing else is available Then a house keeper moved beds apart from each other There was a lot of dust on the carpet between beds House keeper was changing linens and cleaning the carpet while we were staying in the door Service is poor Everything looks better on photos than it is in reality </Bad>

		<Bad> I booked 2 rooms for 4 nights When I came to the hotel the manager told me that they had an electricity problem and asked us to the spend the first night in the other hotel To make it clear I wrote to the hotel beforehand that I will be arriving late and got the confirmation that they were waiting for us I had 2 eldery mothers with me who were tired after the trip The most unpleasant moment was that the hotel obviously was overbooked and they lied to me about some electricity problems I didn t want to scandal and went to the other hotel but at the reception of the hotel where they put us I checked witht the reception lady and she said thet we were the only ones who were relocated for the night from Acca Palace If the hotel is 4 star and wants to be a boutique one it is absolutely unacceptable to sell more rooms that are available Plus my rooms were not just booked they were fully prepaid </Bad>
		<Good> I liked the style of the hotel The room was nice but the bathroom was tiny not what you expect from 4 star hotel It was nice to have a balcony The breakfast was good with large variety Perfect hot croissants Lots of fruits fresh juices etc However last breakfast was a mess There were no glasses cups and plates The staff was not quick enough to replace the missing items had to wait for water for 15 minutes The hotel is situated in the nice area close to metro A huge supermarket is nearby The staff is very well trained and any request is immediately realised </Good>

		<Bad> We were a little disappointed with the hotel pool We weren t expecting something recreational but the pool itself and the area were a bit small and the pool itself was quite cold We were hoping for something a little more spa sauna like It is definitely not an area meant for kids but I suppose the shallow depth would be good for younger children </Bad>
		<Good> The room was very cozy and comfortable It was also quiet which was nice as a little get away from the bustle going on right outside our window The staff was very friendly and very helpful The hotel restaurant was also very delicious and the staff there were polite and attentive </Good>

		<Bad> One of the pillow stint Though the bed pillow and blanket are extremely comfortable The modern design is excellent but the material is too cheap to last and show ages The restaurant serve ok food but not to grommet level Better go marches in the main shopping street or four season for food Local small shop euro 1 4 coffee will do The breakfast tea was served in a large kitchen style steel pot very cheap The tea is way not as good as it s London hotel Though the free ice fruit tea in lobby and Asian tea in spa are very good This shows the restaurant do not match the quality of its lounge and spa The porter is too lazy to take two trip for large number of luggages and they don t use cart This is semi exceptable but do not match the level of hotel is supposed to be Of course I am comparing with top level hotels Even for average 5 star this is an excellent hotel I am just grading this with the real top hotel </Bad>
		<Good> Friendly and helpful staff design facility location The soap and shower gel are way much better than other hotels serving their brand of shampoo The shower facility is very comfortable The spa is small but functional Tranquil The pool is comfortable if less than three people using it Nice design and coloring The jacuzzi has three type of jet Even it s a home grade plastic pool it s extremely comfortable than many marble pool with steel bench The water may not be as clean as commercial grade jacuzzi </Good>

		<Bad> The building isn t much from the outside and the place is looking a bit tired It appears they are under going renovations on the floor I stayed on Could be noisy if you want peace quiet during the day </Bad>
		<Good> I only spent 1 night here after flying into Milan from Australia I booked this hotel as it is conveniently located near Milano Centrale The staff were friendly and attentive The room was clean large for an Italian hotel The bed was comfortable and there was satellite TV The breakfast was good as and what you would expect at a hotel chain The wifi was reliable In my view it was value for money </Good>

		<Bad> I was so sure my charger was left in the room if the reception girl could help me to check further apart from just making a quick call to lost and found clean lady when I was on site it would save me so much trouble on getting it back </Bad>
		<Good> it s a very modern hotel with all the facilities you need Even slippers which are not usually seen in European hotels location is good 1km to Duomo de Milano and several stops to the train station Room is clean and big bathroom is great supermarket is within walking distance and staffs from the bar downstairs are very kind Luca from the hotel is really helpful i found out that i left my Bose charger which is not easy to find a substitute in the room after I checked out I tried to get it back when I was back to the hotel to pick up the luggage in the afternoon I was leaving for Roma and it was my last chance to get it back however the reception girl checked with clean lady and insisted they didn t find anything I had to leave with doubts though I m pretty sure it s plugged in the socket on the wall Then next morning Luca from the hotel texted me saying that they found it and she will help to keep it till my friend goes to Milan next month thanks for your help Luca Really appreciated </Good>

		<Bad> We accommodated room 613 which is near the street and the windows were likely open and it was not possible to close them tightly The beds were quiet comfortable </Bad>
		<Good> The room was big enough and it was very well designed Also decorations were very fascinating Towels have been changed daily which we did not request There s a park spot across to the street which was free of charge but I wasn t sure about the security and one night I saw that there is a police car checking the neighborhood at the other hand parking to the hotel isn t so expensive 8 per day and night The breakfast was quiet enough and delicious There is a metro line 300 350 m ahead which you can reach to the center by changing just one metro line in 20 25 minutes Also Como lake is very close we went there in 45 50 minutes by car </Good>

		<Bad> A pair of my earrings went missing from my room which I had left on the desk The Hotel Manager would not do anything in terms of helping and didnt speak to the staff properly She promised me a new pair which she then changed her mind about She said different things to me everyday Apparently the cleaning lady was new and even though it might have been an accident that she threw them away anything the guest leaves on the table should not be touched There was also NO safe in the room The fridge didnt work either and the sink in the bathroom kept getting blocked The floor was dusty as well We pointed this out to the Manager but again nothing was being done I paid a lot of money for this Hotel and I lost a pair of nice earrings </Bad>
		<Good> The Restuarant staff and the Reception staff were all very very friendly Breakfast was good as well The location was very good and close to shops public transport and restuarants </Good>

		<Bad> The pool was closed not something that was clearly stated in our booking We chose this hotel for its Spa and Welness facilities but without a pool at its additional cost of 15 euros per day it was not worth it The shower head holder was broken but was fixed as soon as we reported it Walls are like paper so if you are hoping for a sleep in you won t get it here staff walking the halls sound like they are in your room Air conditioning was very loud and uncomfortable We didn t eat in the restaurant menu wasn t to our liking </Bad>
		<Good> Staff were very helpful offered good recommendations for Brunch close by Oma Bistro check it out and offered remedies to minor issues </Good>

		<Bad> Breakfast was pretty poor Day after day the exactly identical menu was served For a Germanic city there was no bacon and no sausage And no beans grilled tomatoes or potato in any form In the fact the only thing slightly warm was scrambled eggs which came in single portions inside glass tumblers Apples were the only fruit I had asked for Gluten Free meals and got GF bread but no cereals This was quite annoying because GF cereal is not costly a box providing 10 servings costs 5 Euros but I had to buy my own from a local supermarket I would not stay for more than a weekend in this Hotel as I would be bored to death with the monotonous breakfast We had asked for a double bed but we got two singles pushed together with a gap in between When we complained they said all rooms were kitted like this but instead arranged for a topper sheet which was quite comfortable The taxi fare from the airport was 45 Euros which is expensive The metro and train system would have been much cheaper </Bad>
		<Good> The Location was a huge plus It is exactly 3 minutes to walk to the metro station and 3 stops to the city centre The Hotel staff were friendly and courteous The room was of average size but had all the basic facilities and comfortable beds The windows opened into the backyard The bathroom had good facilities plenty of hot water but only liquid soap dispensers There is a supermarket just up the street and a major shopping precinct with plenty of restaurants of all flavours near the metro station The superb Gluten Free restaurant Zum Wohl is within walking distance</Good>

		<Bad> The price inflated to over 3 times the normal rate for the fortnight because it is near the Wimbledon tennis event At 200 the deluxe double was disappointing having only the small round window at the front for natural light At over 3 times the price it was outrageously expensive Advantage well and truly taken The staff bored uninterested and far too few of them at breakfast On one morning we waited 30 minutes to get our drinks The few staff there were like headless chickens Slightly better on the second day as there fewer guests but still very poor Some tables were set properly ours wasn t Not fun eating cereal with a teaspoon Eggs not cooked as I requested When we arrived at our room there was a huge pile of laundry just outside the door not a good look on arrival At check out we weren t even asked how we enjoyed our stay just as well as the bored reception clerk was answering the phone It was a two star experience for 5 star prices </Bad>
		<Good> Very handy for Wimbledon tennis event and cars were available to transport guests around Comfortable bed </Good>

		<Bad> The breakfast was one of the poorest I have experienced for the price we only paid for it for 1 day and decided to buy our own food though on check out we were told we had been to breakfast 2 days something the hotel needs to look at as you just say your room number maybe show your key too fortunately they believed us and we were not charged for the other day Curtains had lost some of backing which meant more light came through early in the morning </Bad>
		<Good> The location was perfect for us a few minutes from one of the main underground lines and across the road from a useful tram line also not far from the hop on hop off bus could have walked to main train station if it wasn t so hot The room was big comfortable and comfortable with 2 big windows Staff were friendly and helpful having a kitchen area with cutlery plates kettle and microwave </Good>

		<Bad> I have stayed at this hotel a few times when it was the Kensington Hotel and spa and I loved it that s why I returned The Holiday Inn has taken it over and it has gone down hill dramatically in the Service and staff area We were greeted at the front door on arrival by a very grumpy man instead of the Jolly Londoner that was there previously The staff were cold and quite difficult to speak to at times except the gentleman who processed our check out he was friendly On the whole the staff were miserable and very cold not like the welcoming smiling faces you expect in a hotel There were at least 3 different people having problems that we saw during our stay and the manager was VERY rude to one lady I was shocked in the decline of staff and service I will not return here but spend my hard earned money elsewhere </Bad>
